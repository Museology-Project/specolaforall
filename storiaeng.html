          <pa><strong>1. The school of liberal arts</strong><br><br>
            In the early Middle Ages until the XIth century, Bologna was a relatively small inhabited centre compared to the larger towns of Pavia, the Longbard administrative centre of Northern Italy, and Ravenna, bridgehead of the Byzantine empire in Italy, and even Cremona, Mantova and Verona (1). The ancient Roman city had been destroyed in 728 by the longbard King Liudprand (? - 744) and a good part of the old inhabited area, whose right-angled road grid is still recognizable in the centre of the city today, remained "ruined and uninhabited" for centuries. Even for the Longbards, however, Bologna must have been of special importance on account of its geographical position at the crossroads of many important routes and on the border, towards the Exarchate, of their dominions. This accounts for the fact that, while part of the ancient city remained uninhabited, an important Longbard village grew up to the east in the suburban area around the Basilica of Santo Stefano. The two towns, the Latin and the Longbard, lived side by side, the former never completely losing its identity seeing how for a certain period Bologna had two Bishops, one Latin the other Longbard. Longbard dominion lasted about fifty years, until 774 when the Longbards were defeated by the Franks. Bologna thus reverted to Roman rule and, by all accounts, the ancient customs of the Latin city were restored. <br><br>
            When in 825 Lothair I (795-855), emulating Charles the Great (742-814), reestablished in Italy what for the times could be called higher education, he chose Pavia, Ivrea, Turin, Cremona, Verona, Cividale, Florence and Fermo as centres for setting up the schools. In the edict Bologna went unmentioned, which is not surprising given that it was a papal dominion, a dominion that would last until about 898 when the city fell into the hands of Berengarius King of Italy (?-924). The ninth century is a period of particular importance to us for a document that bears witness to the state of astronomical knowledge then surviving in Italy and, perhaps, in Bologna itself. The Codex Manuscript I.27 of the Antoniana Library in Padua does in fact date from this century. Alongside the calendar of holidays presumably observed in Bologna in the IXth century, the codex contains a calendar running from 802 to 1063 and a wide range of scientific treatises, especially astronomical, mathematical and computational, the content of which has been found to agree with the computational part of the Codex Angelica 123. This latter codex, which belongs to the very earliest collection of the Angelica Library in Rome and which will be discussed later, provides a direct record of how astronomy was taught in the Bolognese capitulary school two centuries later (2). <br><br>
            The first thing the Codex Manuscript I.27 reveals, albeit in its essentials, is the sheer breadth of knowledge which, in a century considered so backward, was held to be of interest. It did not deal merely with computus, attested by the treatise of Rabano Mauro (c. 784-856) and extracts from Bede (672-735), but looked at practical ideas regarding weights and measures, a portable solar clock, the planets and constellations, meteorology, calculus and human anatomy, as well as some quotations from Isidore of Seville (570?-636). From what is known of the importance of the episcopal seat in Bologna, at the beginning of the IXth century, of the presence, alongside the bishop, of a body of canons, of the different functions they had to discharge, and of the relative prosperity of the city in that century, it is not unreasonable to consider this codex a truly Bolognese document. If in those years - indeed in the year 802 if the initial date on the calendar is to be believed - the cultural level of the Bolognese curia was as reported in this codex, it would come as no surprise that a capitulary school was active and that the liberal arts of the trivium and quadrivium were taught in Bologna. To be sure the end of the IXth century and the first half of the Xth marked the height of decadence for Bologna, its curia and the areas around it. Already in 884 its biggest church, Santo Stefano, with all its riches, had come under the control of the diocese of Parma. At the beginning of the next century repeated raids by Ungari had brought death and famine to the whole region, even though the story about the fire at the basilica of Santo Stefano was perhaps more a flight of imagination (3). <br><br>
            However, towards the mid-Xth century civic life showed signs of recovery. In 993 sovereignty over Santo Stefano was handed over to the Bolognese bishop and at about the same time the building of a new cathedral got under way. A school attached to it most probably opened up soon after although there is no documentary proof of when it actually started. What we do know is that in the mid-XIth century this school was flourishing given the number of important people who came there to study (4). Among these was Brunone (1044 or 1048-1123), abbot of Montecassino and bishop of Segni, later sanctified, a figure who, while still a young man, was sent in 1070 from Asti to Bologna to study not only the trivium - scilicet grammatica, rhetorica et dialectica, the artes sermocinales - but also the quadrivium - scilicet arithmetica, geometria, musica et astronomia, the artes reales.

          <pa id="2"><strong>2. The astronomy of the Quadrivium</strong><br><br>
            A good question that can be asked is what exactly the study of astronomy consisted of in those days. It probably included mathematics, physics (in the medieval sense), and astrology. We know from the ancient inventories of books possessed by different monasteries (5) and from the history of the so-called "corpus astronomicum" (6) that the mathematical part consisted mainly of "computus", or the rules for calculating the calendar, as expounded, for example, in the VIIIth-century treatise by Bede, the Venerable. To effect these calculations a fairly detailed knowledge of the different periods of the Sun and Moon was required so as at least to be able to fix the date of Easter. It should be remembered that in those days not only was it impossible to acquire a calendar but the actual spread of information, from one province to another and one nation to another, was considered so unreliable it was generally thought every episcopal seat could be left to deal with the matter in its own way. If we accept that knowledge of the physical significance of eclipses of the Sun and Moon had not been completely forgotten in the late Latin period, even if the art of forecasting them had practically died out, we should also accept that the teaching of astronomy must have included a physics, or more precisely a geometry, part. It is possible there was also mention of the irregularity of planet motion along the ecliptic and more especially of the phenomena of planetary station and retrogradation. <br><br>
            Astrology was still the kind referred to as "Latin astrology", as explained in the treatise of Aratus (c.315-c.240 BC) or of Martianus Capella (IV-Vth century) and in the various "Latin spheres". The forecasts, of a generic nature, were based on somewhat elementary data such as the day of the week the new year began on, integrated by numbers drawn, by a variety of rules, from the letters making up the name of a person (7). The Codex Angelica 123 allows us to test the accuracy of such hypotheses for Bologna, at least as regards computation. The first 16 pages of this Codex, compiled in the third decade of the XIth century, do in fact contain a fairly complex calendar covering the period 1039 to 1120, and the rules for its computation, according to the four year cycle of leap years, the weekly cycle of twenty-eight years - marked with the more archaic concurrentes than with the litterae dominicales - the 19 year lunar cycle and the 15 year indiction cycle. The Ogdoadas and Hendecadas are also indicated in the calendar though there is only one brief reference in the text, not enough to be able to work them out. It is reasonable to assume that the presence of this latter cycle, with the characteristic Greek names used in the eastern church but rarely seen in western calendars, is evidence of the relationship between the Bolognese diocese and that of Ravenna which it was then subject to; it also indicates it was Ravenna that actually supplied the calendar even though the exact meaning of it as well as the rules for its computation were not known in Bologna. <br><br>
            Interspersed among the rules of computation in our text are astronomical ideas and quotations from Bede’s De natura rerum and Isidore’s Etymologiae. There are also some specific references to its didactic use in the dialogic forms proper to the prose part ("si vis scire", 5r and many other places, "vide ne oblivescaris..", 6v), gratification with the work done ("avidus calculandi inquisitor artis..", 8v), new discoveries ("Item argumentum nuper inventum..", 15r), divergent opinions ("non est verum quod de luna aliqui coniciunt..", 10v), and the possibility of experimental control of the data ("Horologi intentus qui perbene lineas - certas eorum comprobabit.." 14r) (8). The computational examples (14v, 15v, 16r) all have 1029 as their year of reference. A lack of correspondence in the marking of leap years, in the concurrentes between text and calendar and a few errors in the calendar, together with a disagreement between the calendar and the computus starting dates, suggest that this codex preserves the transcription of an original of a few years before, compiled what is now almost a thousand years ago.

          <pa id="3"><strong>3. The beginnings of higher education in the Arts and Medicine</strong><br><br>
            The existence of the school of "liberal arts" at Bologna in the XIth century is beyond doubt. Irnerius himself (c.1060- c.1130), before starting his law teaching career, had been a teacher of the arts (9). The question to be asked at this point is in what period the old Trivium and Quadrivium studies grew into something "higher" and more advanced.  The fact that in 1136 two scholars, John of Salisbury and his companion Albericus, came from Paris to Bologna in search of knowledge would, if true, suggest an early date (10). Upon their arrival the two men, whose main interest was logic, were among the first foreigners to be able to admire the tower of Asinelli, built in 1110. Apart from the law school, we know that the teaching of medicine also began quite early in Bologna. In the late XIIth century we find a physician in Bologna, Johannes de Bertinoro, awarded the title Magister (11). The medical school must have already been flourishing at the beginning of the XIIIth century as witness the bull of Honorius III which forbade the clergy undertaking this kind of study (12). In the early days and probably for most of the XIIIth century, this school, perhaps in the tradition of the famous school of Salerno, was characterized by a markedly empirical approach to problems of health and the cure of disease, and was not greatly influenced by astrology. <br><br>
            Arabic astrology began to spread across Europe towards the end of the Xth century, an event usually connected with the legend of Gerbert d’Aurillac (c.950-1003). According to the legend - which dates from the XIth-XIIth centuries - Gerbert managed to become Pope through his art of necromancy, the demons having taught him the use of the astrolabe. The legend has some basis on facts which actually occurred. In 984 Gerbert, an extremely erudite man who at that time was abbott at the monastery of San Colombano in Bobbio, requested the translation of a treatise on Arabic astrology from Spain and later wrote a treatise himself on the astrolabe. It should perhaps also be pointed out that in April 998, a year before becoming Pope under the name Sylvester II, Gerbert had reached Italy from France to take up the position of archbishop of Ravenna. It would appear however that the influence of Arab learning on Italian scholars was next to nothing until the beginning of the XIIIth century. The introduction of Arabic astrology into Italy is associated with the name of Michael Scot (1175-1232) and that of the Emperor Frederick II, whose official astrologer he was. As far as Bologna is concerned, the connection was clear. In 1227 (13) the emperor sent a donation of some books on "Philosophy" to the "maestri ed agli scolari" of the University of Bologna. The accompanying letter, written by the "gran segretario" Pier delle Vigne, stated that the donation included "various compilations by Aristotle and other philosophers regarding philosophy and mathematics”. In prescribing the use of these treatises, Pier delle Vigne’s letter paints an interesting picture of what university life was like in those days and bears witness to how the Emperor viewed the University. It reads: <br><br>
            "It is then you, men, who wisely draw from the old wells new waters, which flowing and sweet as honey you offer unto dry lips, who gratefully accept, as gift from your friend Caesar, those books containing the ancient works of the philosophers who come to life again through your voice and whose flame you rekindle, as you wisely spread doctrines, as is fit, integrating them into your school, where authority bears forth the fruit of virtue, the defect of ignorance dissipated and the truth of a mysterious text revealed; you men who do all this at the behest of clients, convinced of the merits of the illustrious work that has been commissioned of you, will one day publish a eulogy for the students and for our fame." (14) <br><br>
            Unfortunately we do not have the list of works sent to Bologna and do not know if these included the astronomical and astrological treatises that Michael Scot had written, at the behest of the Emperor, for the "scolares novitij" (15). We do know however that the orders and suggestions of the Emperor did not generally go unheeded. Around 1220 he ordered that three years of "logica" should precede medical studies and we find that, before taking orders in 1230, the Magister Moneta da Cremona (XII cen.-c.1260) read Aristotle to the "artisti", i.e. medical, students of Bologna (16). We may therefore assume that already at the beginning of the 1200s the faculty of arts was well established.

          <pa id="4"><strong>4. The origins of the teaching of Astronomy</strong><br><br>
            We do not know when exactly Astronomy was first taught at the University of Bologna but, at about the same time as teacher Moneta was making his comments on Aristotle, we find in Bologna the person who would become the most famous astrologer of his time: Guido Bonatti (beginning XIII cen.- c.1296). We do in fact know that in 1233 he was engaged in a public debate in Bologna with friar Giovanni Schio da Vicenza (?-1260), a vigorous opponent of astrology (17). Guido Bonatti left us an astrological compilation, entitled Decem continens tractatus astronomiae, which survives in a large number of codices and which was printed three times: in 1491, in 1506 and in 1550. The book was written shortly after 1277 when the author, who died in 1296 or 1297, was already advanced in age; one may assume therefore that it reflected more the knowledge of astronomy in Italy in the first half of the XIIIth century than in the times when the old author drafted the text that has come down to us. In Bonatti’s treatise the section devoted to mathematical astronomy is rather short. He lays out basic ideas regarding the equator, the ecliptic, the altazimuth coordinates, Ptolemy’s system of deferents and epicycles and illustrates how these can explain the phenomena of station and retrogradation of the planets. Bonatti ends the section: "I will not develop these arguments in any greater detail seeing how a complete review can be found in the Alfraganus" (18). <br><br>
            The book of Alfraganus (Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathîr al-Farghânî) (IX cen.) mentioned by Bonatti is the book known as Elementa Astronomiae, in the 1134 translation from Arabic by the Spaniard Johannes de ;Luna (XII cen), or as Liber aggregationis scientiae stellarum et de principiis coelestium motuum in the translation by Gerard of Cremona (1114-1187) in the second half of the XIIth century. The work, written in the IXth century, is no more than a compendium of Ptolemy’s Matematikè Suntaxis, better known as Almagest, dating from the IInd century AD. The summary presented in the work of the great Alexandrian astronomer has no astrological section and appears simple, accurate and elementary (19). We know that Dante Alighieri studied at Bologna in 1287 and it is believed his knowledge of astronomy came from this very book, in the translation of Gerard of Cremona (20), cited by the same Dante in the Convivio (II,6) with the name libro de l’Aggregazion de le Stelle. In the Inferno (XX,118-120) Dante recalls the figure of Guido Bonatti, placing him amongst magicians, astrologers and sooth-sayers who slowly proceeded backwards "along the hollow vale",  <br>
            "...so that the countenance<br>
            Was from the reins averted: and because <br>
            None might before him look, they were compell’d<br>
            To’ advance with backward gait." <br><br>
            The first lecturer in astronomy at the University of Bologna that we have a record of is Bartolomeus de Parma (XIII-XIV cen.) who began teaching somewhere around 1280 and was still teaching in 1297. In that year he did in fact write a Tractatus Spherae intended to combine the classical excursus of Sacrobosco with more "physical" (in the aristotelian sense) and astrological considerations (21). Given the evidence offered us indirectly by Dante and the composition date of this comment, it is fair to say that, before 1297, the teaching of the mathematical part of astronomy was based on the treatise of Alfraganus and that therefore the treatise of Sacrobosco had only recently come into use. This is confirmed by the fact that we have at least one other early comment on Sacrobosco written for the students of Bologna, the comment by Cecco d’Ascoli (1285?-1327) in 1322 (22). The Tractatus de sphaera mundi, written around 1240 for the students of the University of Paris by the Englishman Johannes de Sacrobosco (end XII cen.-1244 or 1256) - literal Italian translation of the original name John of Holywood - was the first book of astronomy written by a western author: it was not much more than a summary of the work by Ptolemy and the Arabic astronomers, but for those times it was enormously influential. It would remain the most popular treatise of elementary astronomy for almost four centuries, as witness the plethora of comments made on it, substituting once and for all the ancient works of Pliny and Martianus Capella.

          <pa id="5"><strong>5. Astronomy and Astrology in Italy and in Bologna in the XIIIth and XIVth centuries</strong><br><br>
            In the XIIIth century astrology was undoubtedly a highly respected "art" in Italy. We need only think of the ties between Frederick II and Michael Scot, those between Guido da Montefeltro and Guido Bonatti or even the fact that already in 1303 the municipality of Bologna had its own astrologer, Johannes de Luni (XIII-XIV cen.), son of Guilielmus de Luni (23). It should furthermore be noted that in this period astrology had many more ties with public government - the Princes wanted to know their "fortunes" - than with private interests, medicine especially. This is attested by the list of possible uses for a horoscope, as laid out in the treatises of Guido Bonatti and Bartholomeus de Parma. A different attitude comes to the fore at the beginning of the next century. Both Pietro d’Abano (1250-1315), the famous Paduan professor of Medicine, and Francesco Stabili, better known as Cecco d’Ascoli, displayed enormous interest for what would be called "medical astrology". Cecco d’Ascoli did in fact write: "It is indispensable that the physician knows and examines the course of the stars and their conjunctions so that he has an idea of the various diseases and the critical days"; adding also the saying attributed to Hipparcus: "a physician without astrology is like an eye that cannot see". (24) Medical astrology involved the use of horoscopes and this called for a more detailed understanding of mathematical astronomy than had been the case when the discipline had been broached for its cultural content, within the context of the liberal arts. <br><br>
            It was in particular necessary to teach the procedures for calculating the longitudes of the planets and the use of the astrolabe - that wonderful analogic calculator that could determine, at any given hour of any day of the year, the positions in the sky of the stars, planets and ecliptic, and whose working principles, based on the most advanced applications of Greek geometry, remained a mystery to most people. All of this is confirmed by a comment on the Theorica Planetarum of Gerard of Sabbionetta (XIII cen.) written in 1318 by Thadeus de Parma for the students of Medicine in Bologna (25). This short treatise explains how it is possible to obtain, by easy graphical procedures, the longitudes of the planets using the Ptolemaic system. From an institutional point of view things were also beginning to rapidly take shape. In 1287 the Università degli Artisti was granted the same privileges the Università dei Legisti had enjoyed since 1150 (26). In 1289, for the first time, the municipality provided a salary for the teaching of Medicine. In 1334 this privilege was extended to lecturing in Astrology which thus became the ninth salaried discipline at the university; the courses probably took place in today’s via IV Novembre, then via Porta Nova, where lessons of the schools of Medicine, Philosophy and Rhetoric were also held, as witness the memorial tablets that can be found there today (27). In 1379 Blasius de Parma, better known as Biagio Pelacani (?-1416), was appointed lecturer in both Philosophy and Astrology, confirming the close ties between lecturing in astrology and medical studies.

          <pa id="6"><strong>6. The curriculum of astronomical studies in the Statute of 1405</strong><br><br>
            The oldest Statutes of the Università degli Artisti that have come down to us date from 1405. They contain a detailed programme for the teaching of Astronomy which reads as follows: <br><br>
            "During the first year of the astronomy course the Algorismi de minutis et integris (Algorithms) are read, after which the first book of Euclid’s geometry is read, with the commentary of Campanus. When this latter is read the Tabulae Alphonsinae with the Canons is read. After which the Theorica Planetarum (Planetary Theory) is read. During the second year the Tractatus de Sphera is read for first, after which the Canons for the use of the geometric tables are read. Once these are read the treatise on the astrolabe of Messehallah is read. During the third year Alcabitius is read for first, after which the Centiloquium of Ptolemy with the commentary by Haly is read. After which the third book of Geometry is read, after which the Tractatus Quadrantis (Treatise on the Quadrant) is read. During the fourth year all the Quadripartitus is read for first, after which the book De urina non visa (On urines unseen) is read. After which the third edition of the Almagest is read." (28) <br><br>
            The first thing to note about this programme, clearly addressed to the students of Medicine, is the coordination between the mathematics, astronomy-mathematics and astrology parts. The mathematics part begins with the Algorismi de minutis et integris of Sacrobosco, a treatise on calculation techniques which must have been in use for a long time judging from the fact that there is a late XIIIth-century commentary on it written for the students of Bologna (29). There then follows Euclid’s geometry, with the comment written in the XIIIth century by Johannes Campanus of Novara (XII cen.), which was read in the first, second and third years. This completes the mathematics part. The teaching of Astronomy began in the first year with an explanation of the use of the Tabulae Alphonsinae codified in the Canons drawn up by John of Saxony in 1370 (30). There then followed a Theorica Planetarum, possibly the one ascribed to Campanus of Novara (31). Sacrobosco’s Sphera was read in the second year along with the Canons for the use of the astronomical tables drawn up by Jean de Lignières (Johannes de Lineriis) in Paris in 1321 and known in Bologna from 1344 (32). Finally the treatise on the astrolabe of Messehallah (Mâshâ’ allâh ibn Atari) (770-815) was read, translated from the Arabic in 1153 by Johannes de Luna. <br><br>
            In the third year a Tractatus Quadrantis was read, most probably the treatise written at Montpellier in 1274 by Robertus Anglicus and commonly known as Tractatus Quadrantis Vetus. This treatise was published by P. Tannery (33) and can be found with its original title of Tractatus Quadrantis Modernus in the BUB codex 132. Since the treatise took the name "vetus" with the spread of the work Quadranti Novi written in 1288 by Profatius Judaus, this title proves the treatise of Robertus Anglicus was known in Bologna almost from the beginning. In the fourth year the third section of the Almagest was read. This dealt with the motion of the Sun along the ecliptic, the duration of the seasons and seasonal variation in the length of the days and nights. The other lectures were all of an astrological nature. The Alcabitius was the Liber introductorius ad magisterium iudiciorum astrarum - also known as Introductorium - of the Arab astronomer ‘Abd al-‘Azîz ibn ‘Othmân al-Qabîsî (Alcabitius) (mid-Xth century), translated in the XIIth century by Johannes de Luna Hispalensis and which is normally accompanied, in the codices and printed versions, by a XIVth-century commentary by John of Saxony. <br><br>
            Two other astrological treatises were the well known treatises of Ptolemy entitled Centiloquium (full name Fructus sive centiloquium) and Quadripartitum (which is the famous Tetrabiblos or rather Previsioni astrologiche indirizzate a Siro), for both of which a classical commentary exists by the Arab astronomer ‘Alî ibn Ridwân (c.998-1061). The astrological part came to a close with the treatise De Urina non Visa written in Marseilles in 1219 by Guilielmus Anglicus (34). This treatise, condemned to being burnt as a work of black magic by the Sorbonne in 1494, explained how the horoscope could be used, strange though it may seem to us today, to enable the physician to assess the quality of a patient’s urine; since the patient was summoned from afar, the physician had no way of examining the urine directly! Since in more than one codex of the XIVth-century Corpus Astronomicum, still extant in Bologna’s libraries (35), we find several of the astronomical and astrological treatises mentioned above, it is probably fair to say that the programme referred to by the Statutes of 1405 was essentially the one already adopted from the mid-XIVth century. <br><br>
            There can be no doubt however that the main points of the programme are based on the teachings of Cecco d’Ascoli. Between Bartholomeus de Parma’s commentary on Sacrobosco and this latter’s there are not only profound differences in attitude towards astrology that have already been mentioned and continuous cross-references to Arabic astrological texts, but also signs of the courses being organized over a period of years, as witness the declared intention of continuing the course, "Si Deo placuerit" (God willing), by commenting Ptolemy’s Centiloquium (36). God was most probably not pleased since poor Cecco d’Ascoli was soon after burnt at the stake in Florence and no trace remains of the commentary promised on the Centiloquium. By the time the most recent of the above mentioned treatises, the Canons of Jean de Lignières, had reached Bologna in 1344, Tommaso da Pizzano had just begun to read astronomy. Tommaso continued with the subject until 1378 when he left Italy for Paris, summoned there by Charles V. From what we know of him and his medical and astrological interests (37) the 1405 programme could well have been his.

          <pa id="7"><strong>7. The XVth century</strong><br><br>
            Many of the works included in the Statutes of 1405 were later printed at the end of the 1400s or beginning of the 1500s in Bologna or Venice (38). This suggests that the teaching programme, as outlined in the Statute, was broadly followed throughout the XVth century. This century proved to be a truly critical one for Europe and Italy: the study of the humanities expanded and reached a level never before seen and never, perhaps, reached again. At the University of Bologna new disciplines in the liberal arts were introduced. In 1424-25, the celebrated scholar Giovanni Aurispa (1369-1459), who had already taught astrology there from 1392 to 1400, was appointed, after a long stay in the Middle East, lecturer in Greek. In 1440 a chair called "rhetoricae et poesiae et studiorum humanitatis" was established, followed in 1464 by a chair in Oriental Languages. The most important institute for the spread of new ideas was the so called "Accademia Platonica" of Florence which emerged under the auspices of the Medici family. In the new attitude towards life that was beginning to develop there was a strong shift in values away from the idea of "fortune" to one of "virtue"; the former pointed to the dependency of human destiny on factors beyond man’s control, the latter the opposite. As Pico della Mirandola pithily remarked: "You will be able to let things of a bad nature degenerate to a lower condition. You will be able to let things of a divine nature regenerate to a higher condition through the free exercise of your thought." (39) <br><br>
            If the old Princes sought their fortunes in the stars, the new gentry learnt instead to rely only on themselves. This brought with it a profound change in attitudes regarding astrology, as can be seen in Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499), and, to a greater extent, in Pico. This new attitude is to be glimpsed in Johannes Pontanus’s (1426-1503) XVth-century commentary on Ptolemy’s Centiloquium (40), considered more important sometimes for its insights into how the ancients thought than for its actual content. This changed intellectual climate was not without its effects on medicine itself. More than one physician publicly expressed doubts on the actual value of the art of medical astrology. Among these was Nicolò Leoniceno (or da Lonigo) (1428-1524) who read medicine and Greek philosophy at Bologna in 1509-1510. <br><br>
            Pico della Mirandola, in his famous treatise Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem, written shortly before his death in 1494 at a tragically early age, makes frequent mention of this famous physician and scholar (41). Included in the Opera omnia first published in Bologna a few years after his death, the text examines judicious astrology in the minutest detail and takes issue with it not merely from a general point of view but by analysing all the contradictions stemming from its stratification over the centuries. With astrology’s decline, astronomy began once more to be considered in its own right, for its contribution to human learning, as a "liberal art" and not just a technical instrument in the service of medicine. It did of course take some time for this attitude to win out - and we know that until the Enlightenment it did not prevail completely - and many astronomers had to navigate carefully between the two, even after judicious astrology had been officially condemned by the Roman Church in 1586, with a papal bull of Sixtus V (1520-1590).

          <pa id="8"><strong>8. Nicolaus Copernicus in Italy and Bologna</strong><br><br>
            Strongly influenced by his maternal uncle, the bishop of Varmia, Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) set off in the autumn of 1496 to pursue the studies he had begun at the University of Cracow in Italy. The decision to study Canon Law, to follow in his uncle’s footsteps and obtain the canonry that would assure him financial security, meant he had to go to one of the most famous centres for the study of Law, the University of Bologna, where his uncle had studied and taught Law for two years. On January 6, 1497, Copernicus enrolled at the German College for the sum of nine grossetos: "...Dominus Nicolaus Kopperlingk de Thorn grossetos novem", we read in the Annales Clarissimae Nationis Germanorum. The Italian and Bolognese astronomical environment at the end of the XVth century does therefore assume particular importance for the long sojourn of Copernicus. Naturally enough this has always been considered an important event and has attracted the attention of scholars who on the whole agree that, after the works of Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola and others of their humanist contemporaries, some sort of heliocentrism, even if more philosophical and theological than geometrical, was fairly widespread in Italian scholarly circles. They do not agree however in their assessments of the possible effects of this on Copernicus, mainly because he might well have come across similar ideas during his stay in Cracow as a result of the spread of Nicholas of Cusa’s thought throughout central Europe (42). <br><br>
            It would of course be very helpful to have more news about Ferrara-born Domenico Maria Novara (1454-1504), who read Astronomy in Bologna from 1483 to 1504 and with whom Copernicus forged close ties during his stay in Bologna from 1496 to 1500 (43), but the records we have of him are so scanty his scientific personality remains largely unknown (44). According to Kuhn (45) strong ties existed between Domenico Maria Novara and the Florentine neoplatonists who translated Proclus and other authors from his school. Novara’s criticism of the Ptolemaic system was grounded therefore in neoplatonic argumentation and, in particular, in the belief that a mechanism that was so cumbersome and complex could not effectively account for the order that was visible in nature. <br><br>
            Even if cosmological questions had not interested Copernicus, the criticisms nonetheless added to more technical difficulties that had accumulated in the system and that had been pointed up by studies on the reform of the calendar: the effective order of the planets, the existence of "trepidation", the variation in luminosity of the planets and especially of the Moon. Copernicus was not the only one aware of these problems; nor was he the only one searching for a solution. Others included the Ferrarese Celio Calcagnini (1479-1541) - author in 1541 of Quod Coelum stet et Terra moveatur, upholding the rotational movement of the Earth - Girolamo Fracastoro from Verona (c.1478-1553) - whose 1538 Homocentricorum sive de stellis liber unus tried to revive the homocentric spheres system of Eudoxus - and Giovan Battista Amico from Cosenza (1512-1538), an author who though brought up in the cultural climate of Padua must have had some influence on Copernicus’s thought (46). <br><br>
            To understand the evolution of the astronomer from Torun’s thought would be of great value for the history of human ideas but unfortunately there is practically no direct data on the genesis of the Copernican revolution. Accordingly, the possible significance of the various elements must remain a matter of conjecture. Different authors have emphasized the unresolved problems of the previous model, the traces of heliocentrism already present in the classics, and the contrast between the "philosophi" astronomers, tied to an Aristotelian universe, and the "mathematici" astronomers, who used the Ptolemaic model for calculating tables and ephemerides. The spread of Copernicanism is a story as interesting as it is badly documented, in Bologna as in the rest of Europe. Copernicus’s book is an extremely technical text that could only be used by specialists - though without necessarily agreeing with the basic idea, so that the use of Copernican calculation techniques or their teaching did not necessarily imply heliocentric convictions. <br><br>
            The whole question however went beyond just professional astronomical circles and Copernicus’s ideas were supported or opposed by scholars with a variety of interests. Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) is a case in point. There was, moreover, no shortage of serious objections to the Copernican system, even from a modern point of view, which were only overcome when Aristotelian physics was replaced by Galilean. Returning to Copernicus’s stay in Bologna, the astronomer lived as a paying guest in the house of Novara - located probably in via San Giuseppe, halfway down via Galliera - rising rapidly from a position as student to one of assistant and "helper" in the observations. Besides the observation techniques Novara was especially expert in, Copernicus almost certainly absorbed some of his teacher-friend’s ideas which led him to question authority, even that of the great Ptolemy. The Alexandrian astronomer was heavily criticized by Novara over a presumed shift in the axis of terrestial rotation which Novara himself had put forward to explain the differences in latitude of certain mediterranean cities measured at the time, compared to those reported by Ptolemy. <br><br>
            This attack of Novara on the absolute immobility of the Earth must have left a mark on Copernicus, spurring him on to study in more detail the Ptolemaic doctrines and the scientific studies of the ancient greeks, a large part of which had not yet been translated; he thus devoted himself to the study of the classics under the guidance of the local greek teacher, Antonio Urceo Codro (1446-1500), on whose account he translated some letters, later published in Cracow. It may well be that during these greek studies Copernicus translated the Arenarius of Archimedes , a work in which the idea of a heliocentric system of the world put forward by Aristarchus of Samos in the third century BC, is described. In the meantime he carried on his astronomical studies with Novara whose fame as a good observer (47) is substantiated by Copernicus himself when, speaking in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium about the problem of the lunar parallax, he records the observations made in Bologna with Novara of a lunar occultation of Aldebaran on March 9, 1497 and of a conjunction of Saturn with the Moon on March 4, 1500 (48). <br><br>
            The problem of the lunar parallax can be seen as being of fundamental importance in Copernicus’s rewriting of the ancients’ astronomy. It is well known that the artifices used by Ptolemy to describe the irregularities of the movement of the Moon implied a huge variation in its distance from the Earth. At the quadratures (i.e. during the quarters of the Moon) this distance ought in fact to have been half that when the Moon was new or full. This fact would have implied a corresponding variation in the apparent diameter of the Earth’s satellite, something which does not occur, as was well known to antiquity and which had been underlined by Regiomontanus (Johann Müller, 1436-1475) in a paper of his that came out in 1496 (49). It cannot be excluded then that both Copernicus and Novara were looking for pointers to resolve the problem, trying to obtain a direct measurement of the lunar parallax. Evidence of Novara’s interest in the problem of lunar motion can be gleaned from his epigraph, which said of him "he who investigated the moving Moon and the motion of Febo [Sun]." (50) <br><br>
            These are strangely similar words to those used in 1509 by Lorenz Korvin, professor in Cracow and municipal chancellor at Torun, in his eulogy prefacing a translation from the Greek of lyric poetry by Teofilatto Simocatta, a byzantine historian of the VIIth century, which was Copernicus’s first printed work and which ran "He who investigates the swift course of the Moon and the alternate motion of its brother [Sun] and the stars with the fugitives earths knows admirably how to discover the wonderful work of God and the hidden causes of things." (51) It is well known that Copernicus solved the problem by reorganizing in a different manner the system Ptolemy had invented, in a sense anticipating in his method what he would later do for the planetary system. It would perhaps be going too far to suggest that the Bolognese observations of 1497 were specifically designed to verify the Copernican theory of the Moon as laid out in De Revolutionibus or Commentariolus (a short manuscript bearing the first written report of Copernican ideas), where the theory is assigned its correct importance; the Bolognese observations do however show that the problem of the Moon’s motion already preoccupied Copernicus at that time. <br><br>
            Copernicus stayed in Bologna for only four years; when his studies finished on September 6, 1500, he went to Rome on occasion of the jubilee year proclaimed by Pope Alexander VI . He spent three more years in Italy, studying Medicine in Padua and finally getting his doctorate in Canon Law at Ferrara in 1503. Then he went back to his uncle the bishop in Poland to attend to his canonry in Varnia, obtained on 20th October 1497, and his astronomical studies, taking with him the rich scientific and humanistic experience he had acquired in Italy.

          <pa id="9"><strong>9. The XVIth century and beginning of the XVIIth</strong><br><br>
            With the new century astrology went into decline in Italy and Bologna. In fact the lecturing, which already in 1419 was called Astronomia, in 1521 was taught only on a Sunday, losing a good deal of its importance. The last Italian reprint of the treatise of Alcabizio is the Venice one of 1525; the last edition of Ptolemy’s astrological treatises with Alî ibn Ridwân’s comment is the Venice one of 1519. (52) In 1563, under pressure from Carlo Borromeo (1538-1584), the then papal legate in Bologna, the old and in many ways declining university began its move to the new and splendid building of the Archiginnasio, built in just three years to provide a dignified home for it. The old Sunday lecturing in Astronomy came to an end in 1571 with the death of the teacher, Lattanzio Benacci (1499-1572), who had taught for 34 years and compiled the yearly Pronostici. Two years earlier however a new chair called Ad Mathematicam had already been established . The syllabus for this course, at least from 1591, was organized over a three-year period: in the first year Euclid’s geometry was read, in the second Theorica Planetarum, and in the third the Almagest. <br><br>
            This scheme was followed, at least officially, until the end of the XVIIIth century. Naturally the actual syllabus adopted depended to a large extent on the scientific personality of the teacher and the advances of the day (53). In 1576 the new chair was given to the renowned astronomer and geographer from Perugia Egnazio Danti, whose secular name was Carlo Pellegrino Danti (1536-1586). It was with him that astronomical geography became a regular interest for the Bolognese astronomers, reviving a tradition that went back to the previous century when in 1476 the then lecturer in Astronomy, Girolamo Manfredi (?-1493), had edited, together with Cola Martino and Pietrobono Avogario, the Bolognese edition of Ptolemy’s Cosmographia (54) in which, for the first time, the map of the terrestial globe had been redrawn on the basis of the prescriptions and learning of the great Alexandrian astronomer. Before being summoned to Bologna, Egnazio Danti had been cosmographer to Cosimo dei Medici, leaving many traces of his work at Florence, like the meridian line in the church of Santa Maria Novella. This was essentially a new astronomical instrument designed to ensure a degree of precision unattainable with the large gnomons used in antiquity for the same purpose. The tip of the shadow cast on the ground by a gnomon - however big it might be and in ancient times even obelisks were used - is in fact of much worse definition than the centre of the spot of light produced on the floor of a big church by sun-rays admitted through a small hole. <br><br>
            One of the first undertakings of Egnazio Danti in Bologna - no longer with us today - was the building of a second meridian line in the church of San Petronio (for which on December 20, 1576, he was paid 60 lire), by means of which he ascertained the epoch of the spring equinox that was held to be important for establishing the rules underpinning the Gregorian reform of the calendar, promulgated on March 3, 1582. (55) Danti was a member of the Commission set up by pope Gregory XIII to prepare the new calendar and presided over by cardinal Guglielmo Sirleto, together with eight other experts: the Calabrian astronomer Antonio Lilio, brother of the physician proponent of the reform, Luigi Lilio , the Jesuit from Bamberg Christophorus Clavius, the Spaniard Pedro Chacon, the Mathematics teacher at the University of Padua Giuseppe Moleti, the Patriarch of the Syrians Ignatius Nehemet, the Verona humanist Giambattista Gabio, and Vincenzo Lauro and Serafino Olivari acting as consultants on liturgical, religious and legal matters. <br><br>
            The only works of Egnazio Danti that have survived in Bologna are a meridian line and what is left of an anemoscope. The former, built in 1576 and recently restored, is to be found in the Sala dell’Inquisizione (Inquisition Room) at the convent San Domenico and consists of a simple iron strip built into the floor which continues up the wall. The latter is a "horologio per conoscere li venti che giornalmente spirano" (clock for knowing the winds that blow daily), built in the great cloister of the same convent according to a model Danti had borrowed from the Torre dei Venti (Wind Tower) in Athens and then modified; it recorded on a vertical plane information provided by a wind vane anenometer which, as was normal then, spun on a horizontal plane. An outline of the map of the winds can just about be recognized on the wall of the cloister, the rest having been demolished at the end of the XVIIth century, including the six metre turret which supported the wind vane (56). Egnazio Danti was also the author of the big mural map of Italy that can be seen in today’s loggia of the Vatican Museums. Of his successors Magini was also a well known cartographer, leaving behind a large 61 plate atlas of Italy which was then printed by his son (57). <br><br>
            Closely tied to this interest with geography was the long series of ephemerides that began with those covering the period 1554-1569, calculated by the then lecturer in astronomy, Nicolò Simi (1530-1564) (58), followed by those of Magini for the period 1581-1620 (59) and then, later, the Ephemerides Bononiensis Motuum Coelestium begun by Eustachio Manfredi and published uninterruptedly from 1715 to 1844. The work of Copernicus was certainly well known to Magini, the lecturer we have already mentioned and who held a chair in Bologna from 1589 to 1617. Among the candidates for the chair vacated by Danti, who had been appointed bishop of Alatri, was the 23 year-old Galileo (1564-1642). The Bolognese Senate, however, went for the older and better known Giovanni Antonio Magini from Padua who, while not being Copernican, corresponded with Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), Kepler (1571-1630) and Galileo himself. Magini had based his ephemerides on the work of Copernicus and was probably one of the first scholars to appreciate the work of Kepler, the astronomer rightly considered the continuator of Copernicus. <br><br>
            It was indeed a disciple of Magini, Giovanni Antonio Roffeni, then Rector of the University, who invited Kepler to move to Bologna upon the death of Magini to take up the chair that had become vacant (60). Magini and Kepler must have held each other in mutual esteem, given the fact that in 1610 Kepler had asked Magini to join him in Prague to share with him the responsibility of compiling new ephemerides (61). The National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm has a brass quadrant with a radius of 38.3 cm, built in Bologna in 1595 by Arnoldum Scherpenselensem for Io. Antonius Maginus in Bon. Gymmnasio Mathematicarum Professor.

          <pa id="10"><strong>10. The impact of Galilean culture - From Bonaventura Cavalieri to Gian Domenico Cassini</strong><br><br>
            The successor of Magini was the Milanese Jesuit Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598-1647), one of Galileo’s friend. He was undoubtedly more mathematician than astronomer: his Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota (Bologna, 1635) marked a crucial step in the conquest of differential and integral calculus. He should also be credited, however, with making a decisive contribution to the spread of Galilean ideas to Bologna. (62) From the list of the lectures he gave in 1643 we know he taught the basics of the Copernican system - and this just a few years after Galileo had been condemned.Following the death of Cavalieri, the Bolognese Galilean school produced no more personalities of note. The eminent figures in this period came not so much from the University as from the Jesuits, including the great anticopernican from Ferrara Giovanni Battista Riccioli (1598-1671) and the Bolognese Francesco Maria Grimaldi (1618-1663). The in folio works of the former are veritable encyclopedias that were widespread and much consulted in their day: Almagestum novum..., Astronomia reformata..., Geographia et hydrographia reformata..., Chronologia reformata.... The second is famous above all for having discovered the effect that carries the name he gave it of diffractio luminis and for having explicitly set out in his book De lumine (published posthumously in 1665) that the speed of light is not infinite. He was also author of the lunar maps, which remained a part of planetary astronomy, with their reference to so-called laghi, mari and crateri (lakes, seas, and craters). <br><br>
            There were however in this period contrary signals to Jesuit anticopernicanism such as the publication, in Bologna, of the works of Galileo, albeit incomplete (the Dialogo dei massimi sistemi being obviously missing). The Galilean line of thought was consonant with the work of the physician and biologist Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694) - the first to use the microscope for the systematic study of animal and vegetative structures - who, having lived two years in Tuscany, had close ties with the Accademia del Cimento and Geminiano Montanari (1633-1687) (about whom we shall say more later), founder of the Accademia della Traccia, "Bologna branch" of the Cimento. Both were undoubtedly figures of note and played a crucial role in training the next generation of natural philosophy scholars, in whose ranks was Luigi Ferdinando Marsili. It is worth recalling that neither of the two had an easy life in Bologna, Montanari probably paying for the strong stance he took against astrology. In 1650 Bonaventura Cavalieri was succeeded by the Ligurian Gian Domenico Cassini (1625-1712) from Perinaldo, invited by the marquis Cornelio Malvasia (1603-1664) to visit his observatory at Panzano - near Modena, but today unfortunately destroyed - and introduced by him to the Bolognese scene. It is fair to say it was with him that Bolognese astronomy took the lead in Europe, at least until 1669 when Cassini, at the behest of Colbert, left Bologna for Paris. <br><br>
            Even though he could never say so openly, not even during his stay in France where the Church’s condemnation of Copernicus was even more rigorously observed than in the papal dominions themselves, there is no doubt that one, and perhaps the main, thrust of his work was an attempt to prove the validity of the Copernican system, an attempt which had moreover its fair share of luck. A key criticism was over the question of the validity or otherwise, in the skies, of Aristotelian, or perhaps more accurately peripatetic, physics. It was a legitimate target given that the Church, in condemning heliocentrism, had abstained from officially adopting this school of physics as its own. As soon as he arrived in Bologna Cassini had in fact immediately set about constructing a new meridian in San Petronio, the very long meridian line that can still today be admired in the floor of the church and which replaced the meridian built by Danti 80 years earlier. <br><br>
            Its size (almost 68m long), precision-made detail, and easy use meant its accuracy was equal to that of the new telescope-fitted instruments more than 50 years later. From observations made between 1655 and 1669 Cassini obtained three crucial results: a table of atmospheric refractions which remained the most accurate for over a century, a new value for the inclination of the ecliptic, and confirmation of the non-uniformity of the Earth’s orbital velocity, in line with Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. The value obtained for the inclination of the ecliptic was 23°29’15" against the 23°31’30" of Tycho Brahe and the 23°50’ of Ptolemy (nearer therefore than the others to the actual value of 23°28’53"). Immediately after its completion, in 1656, comparing the variations in the diameter of the Sun with the speed of its apparent motion along the ecliptic - both measured with the new magnificent instrument - he was able to write that an actual variability in solar motion had been directly detected by observations for the first time (63). In 1736 Eustachio Manfredi would collect all the observations made with the San Petronio meridian in a volume entitled De Gnomone Meridiano Bononiensi. A "physical" inequality in the motion, set against the "apparent" inequality that the ancients had interpreted as due to the eccentric position of the Earth with regard to the orbit which transported the Sun with uniform motion, destroyed Aristotelian physics in the skies. The motion of celestial bodies proved not to conform to the laws Aristotle had sought to impose on it. <br><br>
            Using one of the first excellent simple long focal lenses, which rightly made the lens-maker from Spoleto Giuseppe Campani (1636-1715) famous, Cassini discovered the rotation of Jupiter around its own axis in 1665 (64) and that of Mars in 1666 (65). It was thus proved that these planets spun on axes inclined somewhat on the ecliptic, in the same direction and with periods not too dissimilar to the Earth in the Copernican system. He also discovered the periods of rotation of the four "Medicean stars" - which enabled Römer to take the first measurement of the speed of light - and, taking advantage of a simultaneous observation of their eclipse behind Jupiter’s disk from two different points of the Earth, provided a practical way of measuring the geographic longitude.Among the various works of Cassini this last was of such topicality and interest that his fame reached the king of France Louis XIV, who called him to Paris to build the new Royal Observatory, the first stone of which was laid on June 21, 1667 the day of the summer solstice. In Paris Cassini did some exacting investigative work on the Solar system with very long focal length telescopes, detecting the separation in the rings of Saturn (which still carries his name) and identifying four other satellites, again around Saturn. Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle (1657-1757), permanent secretary of the Académie des Sciences in Paris, insisted in his writings on the usefulness of the knowledge that had brought Cassini to Paris - especially the computation of the periods of rotation of Jupiter’s satellites - so as to be able to work out geographic longitudes exactly by means of astronomical observations. The availability of geographical maps that were much more accurate than the previous ones had been brought obvious advantages for shipping and trade. <br><br>
            To accomplish the actual measurement of the longitudes, Cassini made use of and enlarged on his vast network of correspondents. Even the restoration of the meridian line at San Petronio, carried out with Domenico Guglielmini (1655-1710), Superintendent of waters, was aimed at detecting possible variations in the meridians in order to "clear up this point, so essential to Geography and Navigation". A similar programme, as we shall see, was to meet with the approval of Marsili, author, with the help of Johann Christoph Müller, of astronomical observations "in open war and under military hardships", not for recreation purposes, but for carrying out reconnaissance of the territory that might be useful for his military duties: a direct and clear-cut relation this between science and power and one that underlay the protection (and financing) the kings of France and England lavished on the Observatories of Paris and Greenwich. In Paris Cassini became a leading light in astronomy - and not just French astronomy - even if he was often criticized for his decidedly Cartesian approach that was negative from a theoretical point of view. From a practical point of view, however, the work of the Observatoire was the first instance of collaboration between intellectuals and government pursued by the Académie. <br><br>
            After Cassini left Italy in 1669, the Bolognese Senate formally retained his chair for him in the hope he would return. In the meantime the Astronomy course was entrusted to the Modenese Geminiano Montanari, first-rate practical astronomer, lens-maker, inventor (at the same time as others) of the ocular micrometer - an instrument he used to draw an accurate map of the Moon (66) - and the first person to systematically investigate the variations in light of Algol, a star he observed closely from 1668 to 1677 (67). The research into the light variability of Algol dealt a further blow to the ancient belief in the incorruptibility of the skies. Montanari is also remembered for the memorable hoax he staged to ridicule astrology (68), a practice which was still officially around in Bologna in the XVIIIth century. It was in fact the Astronomy teacher’s task to compile the Taccuino (an astronomy-astrology almanac). This demonstrates to what extent the institutions lagged behind the ideas of the time: in the final rotulus of the history of the Studio (University), in 1799, we find assigned to the "cittadino dottore" (citizen doctor) Luigi Palcani Caccianemici (1748-1802) the job of compiling the astrological giudizio (judgement) and taccuino for use by the physicians of the city. <br><br>
            Montanari did in fact publish an almanac, Frugnolo degli Influssi del Gran Cacciatore di Lagoscuro ("Hunting Lantern of the Influences of the Great Hunter from Dark Lake") which, produced purposely by chance, appeared to be more accurate in its forecasts than "official" astrology. In this context Geminiano Montanari is of more interest to us than the afore-mentioned Marcello Malpighi because of his overriding concern with mathematics, astronomy and experimental physics. He took an active part in international networks of scientific information, was an eager propagator of new ideas, and helped organize and promote (as we have seen) the Accademia della Traccia, important not just for the level of scientific debate but for the actual training it gave Montanari’s best students. Montanari also drew a clear line of metaphysical neutrality, based on a sharp distinction between metaphysics and "natural philosophy", from the experience of the Accademia del Cimento. It may be that a certain degree of prudence informed this attitude, given that Bologna was part of the Church State, though such prudence, exercised by a majority of Bolognese scholars over a long period, was so long-lasting as to suggest a certain degree of personal conviction. We find it again, for example, in the archdeacon Anton Felice Marsili, promoter of another academy concerned with the study of natural philosophy. <br><br>
            The Galilean model was not the only one known of and valued and was often integrated with Baconian philosophy; the ideas that circulated most persistently, in fact, were those of Descartes (1596-1650), with a tendency to focus at one and the same time on reason, mathematics and experiment. When Geminiano Montanari was summoned to Padua in 1679, the lecturing went on more or less, albeit at a slightly lower level, but astronomical research, in the last two decades of the XVIIth century, was practically nonexistent in Bologna, surviving in only a few private observatories including that of the afore-mentioned marquis Malvasia. Very few traces remain of this period on account of the destruction of the private observatories and the loss of the astronomers’ personal instruments. One of these traces, in memory of the work of Montanari in Bologna, is the meridian line he designed in the building in via Farini which belonged to the Vassé Pietramellara (today Sassoli de’ Bianchi). In a corridor, with baroque frescoes of celestial divinities, one can see up high a hole in the centre of a shield (or lens), supported by two puttoes. It was this the eye of the meridian line drawn on the floor by Gemininano Montanari twenty years or so after that of San Petronio. Under the title "Observationes Astronomicae habitae ad Gnomonem Vassaeorum et Cassina~", the Archives of the Department of Astronomy contain (busta III) the records of the observations made with this meridian, between 1674 and 1690, and their comparison with those performed with the San Petronio meridian line.

          <pa id="11"><strong>11. The Marsili institution and Bolognese Astronomy at the beginning of the XVIIIth century</strong><br><br>
            Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (1658-1730) was born in 1658, the cadet son of one of the most illustrious senatorial families in Bologna. His uncle, Cesare Marsili, had corresponded with Galileo. The young count studied mathematical sciences with Giovanni Alfonso Borelli (1608-1679), astronomy with Geminiano Montanari and anatomy with Marcello Malpighi. He then chose a military career enrolling in the imperial army where he rapidly rose to the rank of colonel and assumed the duties of a military strategist, taking part in the campaign that ended in the rout of the Turks outside Vienna. It was in this period that he began to grow concerned over how things were going in his native city. He was convinced that only technical superiority, in military strategy, had saved Europe from the Turks and that this technical superiority was closely linked to the scientific and technological superiority the european countries enjoyed over the Turkish empire. <br><br>
            Bologna on the other hand appeared to be languishing in veneration of its ancient institutions. The privileges of the arts corporations acted as a brake on technical modernization, those of the University on cultural modernization. When Cassini returned to Bologna in 1695 to make some observations with the meridian in San Petronio he found astronomical studies in a complete state of abandon.Marsili, at first in a private capacity, tried to remedy this situation by opening his mansion - full of natural history collections, physics apparatus, astronomical instruments and books that he had amassed over the years - to any enterprising youngster who wanted to further his knowledge in the field of experimental sciences. At the same time he commissioned Eustachio Manfredi, then just 28 and lecturer from two years in Astronomy at the University, to erect an observatory tower on the roof of the ancestral home. All this took place at the beginning of the new century. The Marsili institution acquired characteristic features from the outset. It was not an academy like those in London and Paris whose operations centred around periodic meetings during which scientific innovations were discussed and the academicians made their own contributions to inventions and discoveries; it was more a place which provided actual instruments for work, where operations were of a more permanent character and where the work of the people involved became steadily more systematic and organized. Marsili at that time was moreover away from Bologna and could only follow his institution from afar with general directives and advice; advice which, from certain points of view, forced it to acquire a measure of self-sufficiency. <br><br>
            Marsili did in fact have to take part, as General, in the war that broke out in 1701 between France and Austria for succession to the throne of Spain and it was only in 1708 that he was able to return to Bologna for a brief stay. Astronomy had a special role in the Marsili institution. The new academies, especially the Académie Royale, had very close ties with "power". They were in fact instruments, not to mention ornaments, of monarchic authority. Astronomy was the most explicit example of this for the immediate effects already mentioned. Viceversa, astronomy was also the first of the experimental sciences to have to give up its artisanal framework for a more collective approach and to require substantial institutional support. At the beginning of the XVIIIth century the astronomical community was already well organized, with a well defined programme and regular cultural exchanges; its institutionalization thus proved to be remarkably simple, not to mention productive. There is much evidence that points to the fact that, from the very beginning, Marsili wanted to do for Italy what the Paris Académie was doing for French geography. Though the programme was never carried through, numerous traces of it remain (69) (70) and help shed light on the origin of the Ephemerides Bononienses, that we shall have occasion to say more about later. <br><br>
            Re the beginnings of the Marsili institution, in a 1780 revision of the guide to the Bologna Institute of Sciences, which had been drawn up in 1751 by Giuseppe Gaetano Bolletti, we read: <br><br>
            "In the midst of this huge apparatus it seemed that Astronomy still wanted some help. What was missing in fact was an observatory tower for astronomical observations. Marsili...wanted the Observatory to be built at his own expense...two whole years went by before the Observatory was completed, the necessary instruments installed, and everything ordered" (71). <br><br>
            As we have already seen, the young Bolognese Eustachio Manfredi, renowned not just as an astronomer but as a promoter of the Accademia degli Inquieti, was given charge of the new building project, along with Vittorio Stancari (1678-1709) whose association with Manfredi went back to their adolescence together. This academy had started off as nothing more than a boys’ game, when Manfredi was little more than fifteen, but had gradually been consolidated and grew into an important cultural institution, a point of reference for Bologna’s brightest students. Its existence was probably one of the factors inducing Marsili to undertake his project. From 1705 it did in fact meet at the Marsili villa. Eustachio Manfredi (1674-1739) was born in Bologna in 1674 and Vittorio Stancari in 1678, by when Cassini had long since left the city. When they began to grow interested in astronomy they were unable to find a teacher in Bologna and were forced to rely on themselves. In his eulogy to Manfredi which he read to the Paris Académie in 1739, Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle wrote: <br><br>
            "The famous Bologna Meridian, designed and built in 1655 by the deceased Mr Cassini, this wonderful gnomon, the biggest and consequently the most useful astronomy has ever had, and could ever hope to have, lay abandoned, neglected in the church of San Petronio; there were not the astronomers for this beautiful instrument. Mr Manfredi, just 22, decided to use it, to spare his country this shame, and was helped by Mr Stancari, his dear and worthy friend. They set about studying astronomy books together, immediately began spending the nights in observations with the best instruments they could have obtained from their manufacturers and were practically the first in Italy to use a clock with a cycloidal pendulum." (72) <br><br>
            Fontanelle’s story is backed up by papers preserved in the Archives of the Department of Astronomy in Bologna. These in fact include a series of Manfredi’s and Stancari’s notebooks which contain observations carried out at the meridian of San Petronio (73). The oldest of these begins with an observation of August, 3 1697, when Manfredi was 23. Between 1698 and 1702, besides continuing with the observations at the meridian of San Petronio, Manfredi, his three brothers and Stancari somehow organized a small observatory in the home of the former. They had an astronomical sextant built by the same Stancari consisting of a wooden sector - 30° aperture and 8 foot (3 m) radius - which was soon fitted with telescopic sights. The instrument’s accuracy was around one arcminute. They also had various telescopes, the largest of which had a focal length of 13 feet (5 m), though of somewhat poor optical quality. The interests of Manfredi and Stancari clearly emerge from the observation notebooks and waste books of those years (74) and from the appendix to Stancari’s Schedae Matematicae published posthumously in 1713 by Manfredi, collecting the inedited works of Stancari and the observations the two of them made in those early years. Manuscript copy of the Schedae Mathematicae... can be found in the Archives of the Department of Astronomy in Bologna.(75) <br><br>
            At first, they set about making systematic observations of relative star positions with the ambitious aim of mapping the sky in a similar way to Flamsteed in England. They soon had to face the fact however that the wooden instruments Stancari built were not stable enough for work of this nature and so they limited themselves to studying the movements of the planets. From 1699 they abandoned the sextant in favor of a telescope equipped with micrometric reticle which together with a good clock enabled them to carry on their observations of planet motion. They also observed eclipses of the Moon, the Sun, those of the satellites of Jupiter, and lunar occultations, with the aim of determining as accurately as possible the geographic position of Bologna. They also observed two comets during 1702. A letter by Marsili dated Brisac March 20, 1703, bears witness to his intention of employing Manfredi in his service as soon as he left the Collegio dei Poeti and finding him a suitable position.(76) <br><br>
            Manfredi and Stancari therefore were given carte blanche in overseeing the building of the Marsili Observatory. In a letter to Manfredi, dated Bologna September 1, 1703, Stancari declares himself: "very satisfied with Mr Co. Filippo (brother of Marsili). He granted me this morning bread, wine and twelve baiocs a day, ten of which he believes should be spent on something to eat with the bread, one on fruit, and the other for the candle".(77) The construction of the observatory rose above the granaries of the Marsili Mansion, in the far North, on what is today via d’Azeglio. The report of the master builder engaged in the project is still today preserved in the Archives of the Department of Astronomy in Bologna, together with a plan (78). The idea of the building is somewhat similar to that of the Torretta, or turret, which lies over the present-day university Specola: a construction with plenty of windows, octagonal in this case, placed in the centre of a large terrace. This construction no longer exists, the Marsili Mansion having been refashioned a few years ago. The architectonic volume can perhaps be guessed at from a sort of roof-terace that lies over the north-west corner of the building. Marsili sent from Vienna, where he was then posted, drawings of "large iron instruments" built in Nuremburg, saying that if they were to everyone’s liking "they would be solicitously ordered".<br><br>
            The instruments were instead ordered from the shop of the family of craftsmen in Rome, the Lusvergs, and were: a movable astronomical quadrant [file 11], "similar but more perfected" than the one owned by Marsili, a mural semicircle [file 16] and a 3 foot (just over 1 m) telescope for micrometric observations. These instruments (with the exception of the telescope which was never built) are listed in a hand-written note of Manfredi to the fol 1v of the first volume of the register of observations carried out in the Marsili Observatory, volumes which are today preserved in the Archives of the Department of Astronomy in Bologna. A second movable quadrant was later ordered from Lusverg [file 12] and all these instruments were then given to the Specola of the Istituto delle Scienze (currently exhibited in the museum); their history can be reconstructed from the documents pertaining to that institution. The observatory also had various English, French and even Bolognese clocks. There were also numerous telescopes, including those of Campani, excellent for the period, with their accessories for setting the instrument up and using it [files 27, 28, 29, 30]. The Specola had cost Count Marsili 2400 scudi to build (79). Manfredi carefully examined all the instruments, accurately making all the corrections necessary to measurements at the time of the observations. The scale of Lusverg’s second quadrant seemed much better and finer cut than the first and on 10 December 1703 the instrument began to be used. With its help the method of using "corresponding elevations" to obtain the transit time of the stars along the meridian was adopted. <br><br>
            When a quadrant is used to determine the transit time across the meridian of celestial bodies by the method of corresponding elevations, the only thing that counts is being able to reposition the instrument at the same elevation; for all other uses, however, the important thing is the accuracy of the scale cut on its limb and the precision with which it has been rectified i.e. the precision of the reading of the scale when the instrument is pointing towards the zenith or the horizon. An examination of the records shows that errors greater than two seconds of time occurred rarely in this type of measurement. Taking into account the radius of the quadrant, this indicates that the estimation for the position of the plumb-line on its graduated limb must have had an accuracy greater than 1/20 of a millimetre and that the clock which was used must have been accurate to one second in several hours. The precision of the scale of Lusverg’s instruments and the quality of their rectification can be inferred from the different computations of latitude of the site of observation obtained with them. The results lead to the conclusion that the markings on the limbs were accurate to 1/100 of a millimetre, not that much inferior, in terms of quality, to the more celebrated English instruments of mid-century (80). <br><br>
            With the main instrument, the mural semicircle, it was possible to observe the transit across the meridian of the stars. There were however some difficulties due to the positioning of the instrument along the meridian and its planarity. In order for the telescope, sliding on its graduated limb, not to deviate more than a fraction of a second, i.e. 5 or 10 arcsecs, from a great circle, the plane of the instrument would have had to be accurate to a few hundredths of a millimetre. To be able to use it for meridian observations, deviation from the meridian had to be calculated, elevation by elevation. To this end, the string meridian was introduced in April 1706 (file 3). This is an instrument as simple as it is accurate: it consists of a thin metal wire stretched along the meridian and tested by the method of corresponding elevations. The image of the solar disk, projected through a small hole in the south wall, makes it possible to compute the moment of the Sun’s passage at local noon by estimating the mean time between the moment when the wire’s shadow, illuminated by the Sun on a piece of white card placed under the wire itself, enters and when it leaves. Error was no more than one second of time, which meant the position of the mural semicircle could be verified by observing daily the differences between the transit times of the Sun along the meridian and the telescope of the semicircle. <br><br>
            The one or two second differences between these transit times spurred Vittorio Stancari to design a completely new instrument: the so-called transit telescope which would have allowed the recording of observations free of any irregularity along the meridian. Unfortunately, this instrument - which was conceived by Stancari at the same time as Ole Römer and Edmund Halley (1656-1724) and whose support is all that has been found (file 18) - never got past the first stages: Vittorio Stancari died on 28 March 1709 of consumption at the early age of thirty, as his friend Manfredi sadly noted in the records. Pursuing their early studies, the two astronomers had then made a whole series of observations of eclipses, sun spots and comets, but one problem remained foremost in Manfredi’s mind as it did in many other astronomers of the period: the observation of yearly movements of the "fixed" stars. An annual variation in the apparent motion of the stars around the Earth - the so-called "stellar parallax" - would in fact have given irrefutable proof of the revolutionary motion of the Earth around the Sun, thus providing observational verification of the Copernican system, as Aristarchus of Samos had intuited 2000 years before. The Marsili institution was already seven years old when Marsili began to think of making it permanent, by donating to the City the collections, the instruments and that part of the mansion which housed it. When the other members of his family learnt of his intentions, they formally opposed the idea, at least as regards the transfer of part of the house, saying he had no right to damage the interests of his future heirs. <br><br>
            The Count took this opposition as an affront and: <br>
            "at once cleared everything from the house; he took himself to live in another place; the Academies closed and everything was packed to transport it elsewhere".(81) <br><br>
            And that was the end of the observatory at Palazzo Marsili. The observation records break off suddenly on May 28, 1709, with the following note written by Eustachio Manfredi, which is also a promise: <br>
            "The semicircle is removed from its mount and moved along with the rest of the astronomical equipment until a new building is put up."(82)

          <pa id="12"><strong>12. The Accademia dell’Istituto delle Scienze and the building of the new Observatory</strong><br><br>
            Manfredi’s observations to discover a yearly motion of the "fixed" stars, that would provide experimental proof for the rotation of the Earth around the Sun and verification of the Copernican system, were suddenly interrupted, as we have seen, by the dispute between Count Luigi Ferdinando Marsili and his family over the donation to the city of Bologna of his scientific collections and the part of the home housing them. The Bolognese Senate managed to dissuade Marsili from taking the instruments and collections away from Bologna, on the understanding that<br>
            "a place would be found them that was big enough and suitable enough to house them; a chemical laboratory would be set up; there would be enough rooms for a sizeable library; an observatory tower would be put up; stipends put aside for the professors; funds provided for the purchase of books, and machines for physics experiments". (83) <br><br>
            The agreement being subject to the consent of the Holy See and a financial commitment on its part, Marsili took himself to Rome to set in motion "all the most efficacious means...to this end" (84). It was on this occasion he got the painter Donato Creti (1671-1749) to portray the main instruments of the Marsili Specola in a series of eight pictures that depicted astronomers intently observing the planets, which he presented as a gift to Pope Clement XI (1649-1721). The pictures are still preserved in the Pinacoteca Vaticana, while some preparatory sketches can be found at the Bologna Pinacoteca and at the Art Institute of Chicago (85). The Pope contributed 2400 scudi to the operation and finally, on January 11, 1712, the notarial act was drawn up for the donation that would launch the Istituto delle Scienze di Bologna. The place chosen to house it was the family mansion of the Poggi family which was then far enough out of the centre to make its price reasonable and far enough away from the hills to get a good view of the sky for astronomic observations. <br><br>
            Further contributions to the Institute, solicited again by Marsili, came from the ecclesiastic authorities in the form of money and equipment, including a clock donated by cardinal Giovanni Antonio Davia (1660-1740) and a telescope of Giuseppe Campani - celebrated lens-maker from Spoleto - with a 22 foot (over 8 m) focal length [file 29], given by cardinal Sebastiano Antonio Tanari (86). The octagonal cypress tube and the telescope lens are today on display in the Turret Room of this museum. The Academy and the Institute of Science were inaugurated on 13 March 1714 and soon became famous throughout Europe. In his eulogy to Marsili read at the Paris Académie des Sciences in 1730, Fontenelle compared the Bolognese institution to Bacon’s New Atlantis, saying:<br>
            "Six professors live in this building, each in his own apartment. It’s like seeing the Atlantis of Chancellor Bacon, the dream of a sage realized." (87) <br><br>
            While on one side Marsili continued to feel a kind of municipal patriotism for his city, from whose aristocracy he came, his cosmopolitan background did lead him to recognize the Académie and the Royal Society as inspirational models for the renaissance of experimental studies in Bologna. The Istituto and the Accademia delle Scienze in Bologna were one of the more faithful attempts to reproduce the French model in a different context, thanks too to the close ties with Cassini and his personal relations with Marsili, even if the English experience was not completely ignored. Marsili was aware of the fact that his idea of scientific research could only be achieved with state support, but the cultural and social conditions in the city and in Italy generally placed limits on such plans. At the beginning, for example, because of both the nature of the models and the organization, many Baconian characteristics came to the fore, as was pointed out by Fontenelle. The Istituto delle Scienze was a public institution and a close tie was contemplated between the work of the academicians and the technical needs of the craftsmen; subsequently, however, the link-up with the productive sectors of society - where as it happened the entrepreneurial classes were of no importance - was lost or else not realized. <br><br>
            The plan for geographical reconnaissance, one of the arguments used to obtain papal approval, was never carried through and does not seem to have been solicited at all by the central government which however made frequent use of the University’s best mathematicians for the solution of the most pressing problems regarding drainage. Marsili’s initial intentions were probably of a purely personal nature: to put together a private collection so he could devote himself to studying once he had given up his military career. The leap in quality from this to the Institute was, for the period, unique in Italy. Many courts had collections of scientific instruments, usually little used, while individual scholars no longer had the means to undertake research. If Bolognese science managed to keep up with European standards in the first half of the XVIIIth century, this was not due simply to developments within individual disciplines (such as the rapid assimilation of Cartesian geometry, infinitesimal analysis and, later, Newtonian optics and mechanics), but also to its high level of institutionalization. <br><br>
            The working programme of the Institute - and hence of the Specola - banned all theoretical research for obvious reasons of coexistence with the University, but, since those attending the one also attended the other, the division was not always that clear. Much more drastic was the ban on all metaphysical subjects, probably due in some part to the influence Geminiano Montanari had on his pupils. Limiting science to a carefully prescribed field did however avoid any dangerous clash with theology and in many ways made it actually supportive of Church doctrine. Thus the Specola continued to work with positional astronomy, neglecting the development of the new celestial mechanics. The most important contributions on the subject were published, in the second half of the century, in the Academy’s journal (the Commentarii) by non-Bolognese authors, in particular Paolo Frisi (1782-1784) from Milan, who was of the opinion that the most outstanding contributions to astronomical studies would come from theory and not observations. Frisi was not the only author of note to publish articles on astronomy in Bologna: mention should be made at least of the Jesuit from Ragusa, director of the Brera Observatory, Giuseppe Ruggero Boscovich (1711-1787), witness to the cultural flowering and prestige of the institution, even in a period of steady decline for the Specola. Frisi was also honorary lecturer in Mathematics at the University (from 1764 to 1784) - though he never taught there - as too was Maria Gaetana Agnesi (1718-1799) who had the same title from 1750 to 1795 for the chair of Analytical Geometry. <br><br>
            The building that housed the Istituto and the Accdemia delle Scienze, as had been guaranteed Marsili by the Bolognese Senate, was to have a tower built onto it to lodge the "Specola". During its construction the astronomical instruments brought from the Marsili observatory were put in a room, thought to be one of the rooms situated on the first floor to the entrance staircase of the tower - the door of which is walled up today as it was then - and on which Manfredi suggested engraving the legend:<br>
            "These instruments, which will soon be moved to a higher position, will allow your mind to understand how the course of the stars unfolds".<br><br>
            This inscription was almost certainly never put up - like the others ordered by the Assunteria (Institute administration) for each room of the Institute - since no trace has been found of it (88). The building of the Specola was a fundamental part of Marsili’s cultural project. Of all the Marsili collections, that various naturalists had also been involved in, it was only the astronomic instrumentation which at first could be used as something other than just a personal instrument of research. This had been made possible not simply by the role of Manfredi and Stancari in the Accademia degli Inquieti but also by a specific project of the general. He had in fact accumulated instruments and books in his Bolognese house with the intention of seeing them used by an academy that would be devoted exclusively to astronomy and experimental physics. The actual reasons that lay behind this grand project of Marsili are not easy to analyse. Undoubtedly on the one hand there was his scientific training in the "Bolognese branch of the Accademia del Cimento", on the other his travels throughout Europe and in particular to those countries where the interest of the bourgeoisie in the systematic study of nature had given rise to the great Academies. Subsequent developments showed the limits on reproposing this model in a different economic, social and indeed academic climate; in particular, Marsili’s expectations about the Institute’s ability to make itself an agent of renewal in the minds of the Bolognese political class and to provide new technologies for its economy were doomed to failure. <br><br>
            Similar motivations, however, if they can easily be attributed to the study of experimental physics, should be more attenuated as regards astronomy. In Marsili’s plans for the new Specola there was undoubtedly great interest in the astronomical determination of the geographical position of Italy’s main cities and thence the revision of maps that till then had been merely approximative. What it in fact amounted to was a redrawing of the old Italian maps - which were still those in Giovanni Antonio Magini’s work, published posthumously in 1620, Atlante Geografico di 61 Carte called Italia - through actual reform of astronomy, as "the French had done for France" and which, according to Manfredi, "was the main fruit borne by astronomical observations" (89). Once the building had been found to house the Marsili collections, Giuseppe Antonio Torri (1655-1713), Regiment architect since 1696 and already charged on a previous occasion by Marsili to find the suitable building, was commisioned, in 1712, to actually build the Specola (90). <br><br>
            There were at that time no practical references on how to construct a building of this kind, if we exclude the spacious Paris Observatory: observations were almost always carried out in the country, outside the city, in carefully selected areas, like Uranjeborg designed by Tycho Brahe, or on small hills, like the Greenwich Observatory. In consequence the architect Torri, who had been involved in the building of the Marsili Specola, discussed at length every detail of the job with Manfredi who already ten years before had outlined, in his correspondence with Marsili, plans for an imaginary building designed to house special and at times encumbering equipment (91). The architect’s plans were sent to Clement XI for approval and work was then able to start. Unfortunately, the death of Torri in 1713 and the difficulties the Assunteria of the Institute found itself in for the rise in building costs brought work to a halt where it remained until 1722-23. Manfredi wrote in the Volume primo del registro delle osservazioni da farsi nell’Osservatorio astronomico dell’Istituto delle Scienze (First Volume of the observation logbook to be done in the Astronomical Observatory of the Institute of Science - records begin on 5 November 1723 and run to 30 December 1844): <br><br>
            "The building of the observatory of the Institute of Science began at the said Institute in the year 1712, but having been interrupted for many years, when it was of no use for celestial observations at all, the Professor, when the occasion presented itself, was advised to find first one place and then another in the Institute building, and sometimes even outside it, to explore the part of the sky he was interested in, and thus, outside a few eclipses, he managed to observe little or nothing in that period".(92) <br><br>
            In 1720 Count Marsili obtained another 15000 scudi from the Pope to complete the Institute. The money was used to enlarge the natural history collections, complete the physics laboratory and carry on with the building of the Observatory. Torri’s plans have never been found but an idea of his project for the Specola can be gleaned both from a medal struck in Rome by Ermenegildo Hamerani in 1720 to commemorate the founding of the Institute of Science, and from the models commissioned from the architect Giovan Battista Piacentini on the drawings of Torri for the occasion of the reopening of the building site in 1722. (93) Finally, Carlo Francesco Dotti (1678-1759), architect and master builder of the Institute, was given the job of finishing the work. Manfredi noted in his registers: <br><br>
            "In 1722 building was restarted, including the completion of the three apartments of the Tower which rose to the level of the first terrace, on which the Turret was to lie; the latter was built in the following year 1723, lacking however paving on the floor and a parapet for its terrace and the other one above".<br><br>
            From October to December 1724 the tower was used to make some observations and we find in Manfredi’s notes that<br><br>
            "The observations are again interrupted because of the difficulty of going on with them; the Astronomer has not yet been assigned his living quarters, and...various other comforts are missing, the doors and windows of the Turret not having been fitted yet".<br><br>
            The order was therefore given by the Pope, Innocent XIII , that the building of the Observatory should be finished by 1725 so that it could be visited by the foreigners who would come to Rome for the Holy Year (94). Manfredi then succeeded in opposing the proposal of some administrators that the tower be higher than the church of San Pietro in Bologna, something which would have slowed down work all over again. The building was completed inside a few years, with several alterations to the original plan - raising of a floor, reduction in width of the balconies, etc. - and in 1727 the major instruments of the Marsili Observatory could be installed. Manfredi had noted at the beginning of the previous year: <br><br>
            "On 29 April 1726 the astronomer was at last able to come and live in the Institute..." <br><br>
            and at the end of the year: <br><br>
            "In this month of December in the year 1726 everything to do with the building of the observatory was completed. The iron gate at the entrance to the hall or chamber of the Turret was fitted. The iron attachments with screw-holes for mounting stands and managing the long telescopes that, along with other instruments, had begun to arrive and be used in the said Chamber were built into the two parapets, upper and lower, of the observatory. The cover of the aperture was also completed, positioned along the meridian in the room that was to lodge the mural semicircle, which was hung from its iron attachments, and the hooks with handles for opening and locking the said cover were made. Likewise a shutter with its fitting for maneuvering it was made and fitted, with the aim of covering and uncovering the hole that lets in the Sun on the meridian in the said Room of the Semicircle, and two notches were made in the two iron fixtures placed at the two ends of the said meridian through which the string marking the arrival and exit of the sunlight is stretched in the plane of the meridian." (95) <br><br>
            The turned "columns", two of which were 11-foot high (4.2 m), the other two 8-foot (3 m), were used together and were fitted with the mechanisms necessary for raising and lowering the telescopes. They were painted green with white veining to look like marble. They belonged to the Marsili Observatory and are described fairly extensively in the 1712 inventory. (They still existed in 1843 and were sold at the end of the last century together with other furnishings that had become useless and cumbersome, including a wooden model of the meridian room). It took several more months, however, to install and set up all the equipment which comprised the instruments from the Marsili Observatory along with the telescope donated by cardinal Tanari, which was mentioned above [file 29], and a clock, quadrant, 13-foot telescope [file 25] and reflecting telescope, along the lines of Newton’s, all donated in 1725 by cardinal Davia (96). The history of these instruments can be traced back through the observation records and the numerous inventories held in the Archives of the Department of Astronomy. The inventories show us that some instruments had been transported to the Institute that even then were considered relics of the past. The 1712 inventory refers to, the "sextans ligneus, quo Excellentissimus Comes Marsilius utebatur cum primum Astronomicis se studiis exerceret" and the "instrumentum azimuthale ad altitudines, simulque verticales Stellarum circulos observandos, Norimbergae Anno MDCXCVI fabricatum...Eo instrumento Marsilius cum de Caelo observationes in castris istitueret, utebatur".<br><br>
            The astronomer was entrusted with not only the Observatory but the Military Room too and was, in particular, given charge of the lectures on Ballistics. We do in fact read in the records of the donation:
            "Control over the Observatory, and of the Military Room, should be given to the astronomer, who will carry out continuous Celestial observations, according to the defined year, which will be established in the Academy of Science, and who several days a week will also teach "fortifications" and "artillery" with the help of the exquisite books, that are in the library, and the many models, and cannons existing in his Room..." (97) The use of the different rooms in the mid-1700s is gleaned from the 1746 inventory.(98) <br><br>
            At first astronomy only occupied the four floors of the tower. It was on the first of these, where the room that provided access to the Meridian Room and the adjoining chamber was - today partially occupied by the shaft of the multi-mirror telescope, built in this century by Horn-d’Arturo - that the working rooms of the astronomer and his assistant were supposed to be. By 1746 the old instruments of the Marsili Observatory, which had fallen into disuse with the arrival of the English instruments we shall say more about later, were already kept in the middle room on that floor. There were also various terrestrial and celestial globes and the armillary spheres, representing the planetary system (today exhibited in the "Globe Room" of this museum [files 51-62]). The floor directly above was meant as the living quarters of the astronomer. On the third floor (the present-day "Globe Room") there were other instruments, notably a brass parallactic telescope, donated by Benedict XIV (1675-1758) in 1752, the reflecting telescope donated by Cardinal Davia and two quadrants, one already in the Marsili Observatory and one donated by Cardinal Albani in 1728. The quadrant is named for the first time in the observation records under the date December 31, 1843, but was not refound. The same with the parallactic donated by Benedict XIV.(99) <br><br>
            In the great inner hall of the turret (in the museum called today the "Turret Room") were kept the quadrant donated by Davia and all the accessories for the long telescopes (which are still today exhibited there [files 24-31]), the lenses of the two telescopes by Campani, in their turned wood frames, those of Marco Antonio Cellio (second half XVIIth century) and Chiarelli, both 14 foot (5.4 m), those of the two 8 foot (3 m) "germanic" telescopes, the tin tubes these lenses were used on, the wooden stands to support them on the object lens side, the tripods for support on the eyepiece side, and finally the cycloidal clock of Isaac Thuret (?-1706), which has since been lost (100). Later, as is shown by the 1843 inventory, the astronomer must have been living on the second floor of the building, where the optics and lathe rooms had been. The middle room of the floor above, the first floor of the tower, held the lecture hall that was fitted out with a big table surrounded by nine benches and an armchair, placed on a wooden support, for the teacher. On the floor above were the working and study rooms. The "nautical things" had been moved to the third floor of the tower, including the model ships that can today be found in the Ship Museum of this University.<br>

          <pa id="13"><strong>13. The cultural projects of Luigi Ferdinando Marsili and Eustachio Manfredi</strong><br><br>
            It is clear from what has been said so far that the scientific personality of Manfredi played a determinant role in both the creation of the Marsili and Palazzo Poggi Specolas and in characterizing the Bolognese astronomical observations of the late 1600s and the 1700s. Two particular aspects of his scientific personality stand out. On the one hand is his committed professionalism, reflected in his geographical studies - Manfredi’s method for computing longitudes, by means of star occultations from the side of the moon, is reported in the cited reference (101) -, his compilation of the Ephemerides Bononienses (102), his work on reform of the calendar (103), his determining of the basic elements of the apparent motion of the Sun (104), and the work as geographer and geodesist he was commissioned to do by princes and cities regarding the ever recurrent "question of the waters". Manfredi dealt with the "principal question" of the running of the Reno into the Po, the rivers of Ravenna and the Tiber. At the behest of the Senate of Luni and the archduke of Tuscany he also studied the course of the Serchio river. (105) <br><br>
            On the other is his interest as "philosopher" in doctrines regarding the physics of the sky, the debate on different "world systems", the principles of Newtonian physics (106). One idea, furthermore, was always present in Manfredi’s work, as it had been in Marsili’s original programme: the possibility of finding practical interests in "natural philosophy" research - what Manfredi himself had defined as "benefits not to be laughed at, that civil society reaps from astronomy." (107) The scientific programme for the Bolognese Specola, as conceived by Manfredi and discussed with Marsili, mirrored that of the London and Paris Observatories, and - especially, as we have seen, for Marsili - was more a programme of astronomical geography than astronomy real and proper. Marsili had in fact also been a military engineer in the Balkans in the service of the imperial army and had there been faced with the problem of astronomically determining the geographic coordinates of certain localities where military campaigns were being conducted. It should also be remembered that the work done in Bologna, mid-way through the century, by Gian Domenico Cassini, and in particular his observations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites which had enabled him to develop a practical method for determining geographical longitude, had undoubtedly left its mark on Bolognese cultural and scientific circles and especially on the young Manfredi. <br><br>
            In 1711 Manfredi wrote to Marsili who was visiting Rome to solicit the Pope on behalf of the Bolognese Institute: <br>
            "The main benefit to be drawn from astronomical observations is the reform of Geography. It is badly needed in Italy where the maps of Magini are all wrong in their scale and much worse than those that are being published daily in Italy and especially in Rome. The job of correcting Italian geography requires the fixed residence of an Astronomer in an Observatory, as in fact will be the case of Your Grace, and also requires that one or two other Astronomers will travel round the beaches, and main points, to finish the work in a couple of years...".(108) <br><br>
            Work along these lines had in fact already been done: the difference in longitude between Bologna and Paris had been accurately computed, simple and transportable instruments had been designed to measure noon in different localities by the method of corresponding altitudes (109), a list of longitudes obtained by occultations of stars from the Moon, using a method devised by Manfredi, had been published in the Mèmories de l’Académie Royale des Sciences (110). Despite this, however, the programme was not implemented: it was probably too ambitious for the times and for the political conditions obtaining in Italy. A few initiatives did however survive that can be seen as linked to it in some way. The most important was the compilation and printing of the Ephemerides Bononienses (111), which for decades remained the most extensive and complete among the many produced in Europe, and which, having reached a wide audience, helped make the Bolognese institution famous. Compiled by Manfredi with important help from his sisters Teresa and Maddalena and using the so-called "Cassinian" tables - produced in Paris and obtained following solicitation by Marsili - the Effemeridi Bolognesi contained everything that could be useful for astronomically computing the geographical coordinates of places. <br><br>
            At the end of the manuscript Introductio in Ephemerides, we read the following note, missing in the printed edition: "I began the ephemerides of December 1712 in Bologna. With many interruptions they were continued in the following years with the help of my two sisters Maddalena and Teresa, and of Mr Giuseppe Nadi, and a while after of Mr Cesare Parisij... The table of longitudes and latitudes was calculated by my sister Maddalena around 1702 - 1703".(112) Moreover, in the copy of the original tables preserved in the Estense Library (Manoscritti Campori 2428) we read the following hand-written note by Manfredi "originals of Cassini tables sent me at different times by Mr Maraldi with the knowledge of Mr Cassini".(113) For the first time the calculations were developed to such a point that the work could be done even by non specialists - and here we see the mark of the illuminist ideas of the craftsman, Manfredi, and of the maecenas, Marsili and their joint project of opening scientific discoveries to the public - offering detailed synopses of the ephemerides of the Moon and planets and all kinds of information on solar and lunar eclipses, as well as Jupiter’s satellites, and on the occultations of stars from the Moon. Furthermore, they were accompanied by an introductory volume - the above mentioned Introductio in Ephemerides - which described their use in detail and how the different astronomical operations should be performed in the defined places. <br><br>
            As was pointed out at the beginning, the Bolognese astronomers had always managed to combine personal and "philosophical" interests with these "practical" and, as it were, "institutional" tasks. Interest in the Galilean "problem of the Systems of the World", i.e. the still heated debate on the geocentric and heliocentric systems, and the emerging Newtonian physics was at the time enormous. We need only recall that in 1722 Marsili, already sixty-four and in poor health, wanted to go all the way to England to pay homage to the then president of the Royal Society, Isaac Newton (1643-1727), by whom he was in fact solemnly received as an old member. The Bolognese Observatory would benefit greatly from these contacts (114). Before this date, in the mid-XVIIth century, Gian Domenico Cassini had built and used the meridian in San Petronio to demonstrate - successfully (see also chapter 10) - the non uniform nature of the relative motion of the Earth and the Sun, demolishing once and for all the Aristotelian celestial physics of uniform motion (115). <br><br>
            What was still missing, however, at the end of the XVIIth century was definitive proof of the Earth’s motion around the Sun, and indeed around itself. Proof of this latter, as we shall see, would have to wait till Giovan Battista Guglielmini’s experiments in Bologna at the end of the 1700s on the fall of bodies, and those of Léon Foucault (1819-1868) in Paris in the mid-XIXth century on the simple pendulum. An experiment, however, which since early Antiquity had been viewed as crucial for verifying the Earth’s motion around the Sun was the observation of the parallax of the fixed stars: the apparent change in the position of the stars during the year due to the Earth’s rotation around the Sun - a change, however, which, because of the enormous distance of the stars, was very small and hence difficult to measure. With the new instruments of the late XVIIth century - that used the telescope as sighting instrument on sextants and other astronomical positional instruments - and the introduction of pendulum clocks, increasingly accurate in measuring transit times, it seemed the moment had come to make such measurements. Many astronomers did in fact engage in this kind of observation, using different techniques and obtaining discordant results. Galileo had computed the annual parallax of the fixed stars at around three arcmins, comparing the apparent diameter of the Sun with the apparent diameter of the stars, that he thought he could measure with the telescope. Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), on the basis of an estimate of the difference in brightness between Sirius and the Sun, had assumed a parallax value for this star of about ten arcsecs. Using the reflected light of the planets to estimate the difference in size between the stars and the Sun, Newton had arrived at a value of thirty-six hundredths of an arcsec for the nearest stars, a value which is not that far off the real one. <br><br>
            We have to wait till 1838 when Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784-1846) measured the angular distance between the star 61 Cygni and two faint nearby stars, observing them from Königsberg for six consecutive months, i.e. until the Earth and with it the observer had passed from one extremity to another of the orbital diameter. The instrument used by Bessel was a heliometer, built by Joseph Fraunhofer (1787-1846) according to the new technique of splitting the object glass in half along the optical axis so as to produce in the field of the same instrument two images of the object observed. This instrument was used to measure the diameters of planets and the Sun (hence the name) and of small angular distances, superimposing the images of two nearby stars by displacing the two halves of the object glass. Measurement of this displacement in millimetres, after suitable calibration, provided the angular distance between the two stars [file 41]. <br><br>
            Bessel’s observations led to the computation of an angle, for 61 Cygni, of thirty-one hundredths of an arcsec. Today’s parallax value for the star measured by Bessel is twenty-nine hundredths of an arcsec. Today we know that the star nearest to us is Proxima Centauri whose parallax is sixty-six hundredths of an arcsec. Indeed, as the definition of stellar parallax tells us, the higher its value, the nearer the star. We do not know of any stars today with a parallax value higher than that of Proxima Centauri, part of a three star system whose other two stars, slightly farther away, are Â Centauri A and B. Going back to the afore-mentioned XVIIth-century attempts at measuring the parallax, it is difficult to say to what extent these estimates were known and appreciated by astronomers of the time. Some, for example, viewed the problem very schematically and terms of commensurability between the diameter of the terrestial orbit and the orbe magno, the sphere of the fixed stars recalling Archimede’s text that referred to the heliocentric system conceived by Aristarchus in the third century BC (116). <br><br>
            What is certain is that towards the end of the XVIIth century, various astronomers were hunting after it, including Robert Hooke (1635-1703), Ole Römer (1644-1710), John Flamsteed (1646-1719) and Jacques Cassini (1677-1756). During these tricky observations indications began to emerge, non too comprehensible, of movement of the fixed stars away from their mean positions. Today we can say that these effects were, at least in part, due to light aberration and variations produced by pressure and atmospheric temperature on refraction. This latter effect was certainly behind the variations in altitude of the Pole Star, already observed in 1671 by Jean Picard (1620-1682) at Uranjeborg while he was trying to improve on measurement of the geographical site coordinates of Tycho Brahe’s famous observatory. At first these "aberrations" were taken as indication of parallactic effects even if it soon became clear their internal agreement was poor and they did not fit in with expectations for such motion. Confirmation of Newtonian celestial physics would have led, via Kepler’s laws that can be deduced from it, to confirmation of the Copernican system. This explains the interest Manfredi showed (117) in the question of the perturbations in planetary motion. <br><br>
            Another method for proving the diurnal rotation of the Earth was to determine its flattening, due to the effects of centrifugal force, as first suggested by Huygens. Initial results to this end, however, were somewhat contradictory and much time and effort was needed to settle the issue. The Bolognese astronomers also contributed to this question when Eustachio Zanotti (1709-1782) - assistant at the Bologna Observatory from 1729 and Manfredi’s successor as director - suggested using observations of star occultations from the Moon to define the shape of the geoid (118). The contribution of Bolognese astronomy to these issues will be rapidly illustrated in the pages that follow, paying particular attention to Manfredi’s studies on aberration and to the compilation, by Zanotti, of the first modern star catalogue, based on the mean positions of the stars.

          <pa id="14"><strong>14. The contribution of Eustachio Manfredi to studies on aberration of light</strong><br><br>
            A few years before the Marsili Observatory was set up in 1699, Jacques Cassini, son of Gian Domenico, had published a paper (119) examining observations regarding the variations in elevation of the Polar Star, recorded in a letter of 1698 sent by John Flamsteed to John Wallis (1616-1703) and included by this latter in the third volume of his works (120). On the basis of observations carried out from 1689 to 1697 and an analysis of Hooke’s observations of 1669, Flamsteed confirmed the seasonal variations in elevation of the Polar Star noted by Picard in 1671 (121). In discussing Flamsteed’s results and confirming their accuracy, Cassini did however show how Flamsteed had made a mistake in attributing the variations observed to a parallactic motion, not having taken account of the inclination of the terrestial equator on the ecliptic. Since 1704 the Parisian astronomers had been conducting observations regarding possible variations in transit times along the meridian of two stars. In 1707 Giacomo Filippo Maraldi (1665-1729), nephew and assistant of Gian Domenico Cassini, communicated a series of observations to Manfredi concerning the differences in transit of Sirius and Arcturus on the meridian, carried out between 1704 and 1705. Manfredi immediately began similar observations in Bologna, from the Marsili Observatory (122). <br><br>
            Though of top quality, the Bolognese observations were carried out over too short a period of time - because of the interruption in work caused by closure of the Marsili Observatory - to be able to confirm the effect contained in the Parisian ones. Manfredi had however begun a systematic study of the effects of parallactic motion, the results of which he collected in a pamphlet of 1722 that was to form the first part of the work entitled De annuis inerrantium stellarum aberrationibus, published in 1729. Jacques Cassini had raised the question of parallaxes again in 1717 (123), having observed, from 1714 to 1715, the meridian elevation of Sirius with a telescope set along the meridian and noticing small variations in elevation during the different seasons of the year. His observations corresponded to a parallactic half amplitude movement of eight arcsecs and were in close agreement with the measurements contained in Huygens’s Cosmoteros. A few years later, in 1725, Samuel Molyneux (1689-1728) began observations, in the Royal Observatory at Kew, of the star Â Draconis with a vertical telescope, as Hooke had done more than fifty years before. At first, in 1726, Molyneux and James Bradley (1692-1762), who helped him with the observations, had convinced themselves that the declination of the star changed constantly, dropping continuously until in May it inverted its movement, reaching the highest point of its oscillation in September, with an excursion of 39 arcsecs. <br><br>
            The Bolognese astronomers received notice of these observations towards the end of 1726 from the copy of a letter William Derham (1657-1735) - English gentleman who was a lover of astronomy and author of two books entitled Physico-Theology and Astro-Theology - addressed to his brother Thomas, British Ambassador in Rome (124). In this letter Derham begged his brother to thank Marsili for having procured him a copy of the Italian translation of his Physico-Theology and then mentions the initiative of Molyneux. As soon as the equipment was operative again in the Specola in May 1729, the question of parallaxes was the first issue the Bolognese astronomers addressed with their observations. Selecting certain stars that were bright enough that they could be observed during day-time too, Manfredi set about the actual observing using Lusverg’s mural semicircle, the biggest instrument in the observatory [file 16]. At first the observations dealt almost exclusively with Sirius and Arcturus, the same pair of stars that had already been observed in Paris and Bologna twenty years before. At the beginning of 1729 Manfredi collected his studies in a pamphlet and on April 2 the papal archiater Antonio Leprotti, a close friend of his, wrote him regarding the difficulties he ran with censorship because of the suspicion that the thesis of the Earth’s motion was given too much attention in the text (125). On May 30 of the same year, however, the work got the imprimatur of the Bolognese inquisitor. <br><br>
            The book, the above mentioned De Annuis Inerrantium Stellarum Aberrationibus, is dedicated to cardinal Giovanni Antonio Davia, archbishop of Rimini, lover of astronomical studies and probably a convinced Copernican, given that in 1726 he had donated to the Bolognese observatory a large armillary sphere - currently on exhibition in the "Globe Room" of the museum [file 52] - which represented that very system of the world (126). The final chapters of the book which critically examine the observations available, first those of the parallactic motion in elevation, then those regarding the effects in right ascension, demonstrate how the experimental evidence appeared at that time contradictory. Manfredi in fact discovered that Robert Hooke’s observations and those of Jacques Cassini on Sirius could be accounted for by parallactic motion. Such an explanation could not however be applied to Flamsteed’s observations or those regarding the difference in transit times of Sirius and Arcturus. In relation to these latter observations Manfredi reported very close agreement between the data obtained in Paris from 1704 to 1705 and the data obtained in Bologna in recent years. It is not all that clear what problems ecclesiastic censoreship might have had with this publication but Manfredi was asked to openly express himself against the Copernican theory. An examination of the manuscript (127) would seem to show that the expression "Copernici sectatores" (the sectarians of Copernicus) was introduced as a correction, probably the only modification that was made. <br><br>
            Already in October 1728 Manfredi had widened his programme to include 14 stars, making it thus more systematic and leaving the impression that he had already, by that date, received news of Bradley’s discovery. After a year’s observations of 12 stars with a new zenithal sector of George Graham (1673-1751), Bradley began in 1728 to notice a certain regularity in their motion, a sign this of a general phenomenon, not just limited to a few stars. The amplitude and type of periodicity of this motion excluded any parallactic motion or change in the Earth’s axis explanation. As soon as Bradley was sure in his mind that the cause of these variations was due to the combined effect of the Earth’s motion and the propagation of light, he explained it in a letter to Sir Edmund Halley, president of the Royal Society, that was then published in the December 1728 issue - an issue that came out in February 1729 - of the Philosophical Transactions (128). Halley referred Bradley’s work to the Royal Society only summarily - perhaps to guarantee him priority for the discovery - but Leprotti sent Manfredi a copy of a letter by Jean-Théophile Desaguliers (1683-1744) to Brooke Taylor (1685-1731), published in the Journal Literaire of 1729, from which it was possible to extract some details. <br><br>
            With Leprotti and Thomas Derham, Manfredi was still working on translation of the letter and a complete understanding of Bradley’s work (129), preparing then a short study on the question. The study, finished in October 1730, got round the difficulties of the Inquisition (130) and came out in 1731 in the first volume of the Bolognese Institute’s Commentarii with the title De novissimis circa fixorum siderum errores observationibus, remaining for years the only study confirming Bradley’s work. The study described in detail the series of Bolognese observations - carried out between October 1728 and October of the following year - and accurately analyzed the observations of Peter Horrebow (1679-1764, Römer’s successor and author in 1727 of Copernicus Triumphans) and those of Bradley. Manfredi illustrated how the Bolognese observations were in perfect keeping with the new law expounded by Bradley, underlining the fact that the law had been deduced from variations of motion in declination and that verification dealt with variations in right ascension, something therefore that was relatively independent from the observations Bradley had worked on and destined thus to strengthen faith in the correctness of the interpretation he had proposed. In the final part, however, Manfredi is careful not to express an opinion that would tie him too closely to Bradley’s explanation confirming the Earth’s motion. We know for sure that the problem of the study’s actual structure was discussed with Leprotti who, in November 1730, wrote Manfredi: <br><br>
            "On the other hand it will not be possible to print the afore-mentioned dissertation, except as you thought, and an examination of Horrebow’s observations found inconclusive for the annual parallax will greatly help in lifting suspicions!" (131) <br><br>
            In October of the previous year, in fact, Manfredi had already written Leprotti, claiming he had spoken, in his study, of a moving Earth, as a hypothesis, only out of censorial necessity (132). The doubt still remains however that Manfredi was content to consider the physics part of astronomy as relatively hypothetical, inclined to give greater weight, in terms of truth value, to the purely geometric part. In the Instituzioni Astronomiche, published in 1749, which collect his university lectures, he in fact affirmed that the ultimate truth to be discovered in astronomy were the mathematical rules that accounted for the movement of the stars in the sky; that the "physical" theories on the why of these movements were somewhat hypothetical; that such theories could at times do great damage, diverting attention away from the correct interpretation of events - and here he cites the cartesian vortices - even though he had to admit that Newton’s system accorded wonderfully with the facts and was the only one which, in his opinion, had any chance of being correct.(133)

          <pa id="15"><strong>15. The English instruments and the star catalogue by Eustachio Zanotti</strong><br><br>
            In 1735 Manfredi decided to initiate a new series of observations, using Lusverg’s mural semicircle [file 16], adjusted for maximum accuracy and fitted with a new lens and eyepiece, designed "by Dr. Francesco Vandelli professor of military architecture at the Institute" (134). The results however were not satisfactory, probably because of the accuracy that recent observational techniques had achieved and that the instruments of Lusverg, built several decades before, could not match (135): "The Observatory needs better instruments, something that the experience of eight years or more has increasingly taught us" (136). The assignation of funds to the Istituto delle Scienze by Pope Clement XII (1652-1740) in 1738 provided Manfredi with an opportunity to ask for a new series of instruments. The private correspondence between Manfredi and the papal archiater Leprotti and the official correspondence between the Administrators of the Institute, the Bolognese Senators and the Bolognese ambassador in Rome allow us to follow the affair in some detail (137). The intervention of cardinal Davia, Leprotti and the afore mentioned English ambassador in Rome, Thomas Derham, helped conclude negotiations with the papal court. <br><br>
            "...and the other remaining 1000 S[cudi] are for buying in England certain instruments, and tools, absent from the rooms of Astronomy and Experimental Physics", the Bolognese ambassador in Rome wrote the Administrators on February 8, 1738. Derham took charge of the order in England and, as we learn from a letter of Manfredi to Leprotti dated 9 August, the Royal Society also intervened in the matter of their construction, thanks to the ties Manfredi, through his studies on aberration, had struck up with that Society, to which he became associated from 1729. From the very start the name of the Englishman George Graham emerged as the craftsman to commission the instruments from. Graham was the successor of the celebrated watch-maker Thomas Tompion (1683-1713)- builder of the quadrant used by Hooke - whose workshop he had taken over in Fleet Street. In this laboratory - whose sign was At the Dial and One Crown - Graham had come up with numerous inventions that had benefited mechanical watch-making greatly and, around 1710-1715, had started work on astronomical instruments, bringing a series of improvements to them. He had in fact built the instruments Halley had renewed the Greenwich Observatory with and the ones Bradley had used to observe the aberration of the fixed stars; he had also designed the model of the mural quadrant which, with a few alterations, would remain the basic instrument for every observatory for the whole century. The prototype of this instrument, installed in Greenwich in 1725, became widely known because of its minute description in the 1738 work, A compleat system of optics, by Robert Smith (1689-1768), professor in Astronomy at Cambridge. <br><br>
            Manfredi could not have known this book which was translated in German in 1755 and French in 1767, but the fame of the English craftsman had undoubtedly convinced him of the need to acquire the new instruments for his laboratory. Any early hopes he entertained of receiving the new instruments in good time were, however, quickly dashed for reasons of both manufacturing times and increased costs (138). He in fact did not live to see completion of the deal to purchase the English instruments. The worsening of his stone condition (Urinary bladder lithiasis), which for years had tormented him, caused his death on February 14 1739, just a month after the death of Thomas Derham. The Bolognese ambassador in Rome went on with the transaction and on March 25 of that year informed the administrators of the Institute that the instruments would be ready inside two months. The instruments - mural quadrant, transit telescope, and moveable astronomical quadrant - are on exhibit in this museum [files 14, 17, 19 and 35) and, among the letters to the Istituto delle Scienze, the original invoice has been found, dated June 1, 1739, and signed by the craftsman who built them, the Jonathan Sisson who is considered successor to the Graham tradition and the most important English scientific instrument maker - together with his son Jeremiah - of the mid-XVIIIth century. <br><br>
            The actual price was well above the 1000 scudi that had been talked about originally: the 245 pounds amounted to 5500 scudi and all record had been lost of how much had been agreed between Derham and the English craftsmen. A document (139) tells us that the instruments were shipped from London only in May of 1740, after the Zagnoni Bank in Bologna had charged, in a letter of January 27 of the same year, "Mr. Gistard and Alexander Compagni traders in that market" to see to the payment and that the relative draft, contested on February 27 by the said Compagni traders, had been honored with "money obtained with some difficulty from other transactions". The instruments, the document goes on, were "loaded on the ship called - Expedition - of the Englishman Captain Salcott; and they left England; shortly after it is known the ship was forced to return to port because of the appearance from the Lands of France of the French fleet; and the latest news is that the ship with this cargo then made the trip with a large mercantile convoy escorted by war ships, and that they all reached Gibraltar some time ago, but that only a part of the convoy headed off on the journey to Leghorn, the other merchant ships remaining in Gibraltar for lack of escort; and that among these remaining in Spain is the ship with the cargo bound for the Institute." <br><br>
            Eventually the ship arrived in Leghorn and, towards the end of February 1741, the instruments reached Bologna. There to receive them was Eustachio Zanotti who, in the first pages of the seventh volume of the observation logbooks - indicated also as "first volume regarding the use of the new English instruments" - wrote: <br><br>
            "...at last the new astronomical instruments made in England arrived in Bologna, instruments which had already been ordered years before when the celebrated Mr. Eustachio Manfredi, first Astronomer of this Institute, was alive. The boxes were opened in the rooms of the Assunteria where in the days that followed recognition was made of all the pieces and their uses and how best to assemble each instrument, in which state it remained for some time in the said rooms to give the administrators of the Institute and the Professors plenty of time to satisfy their curiosity and contemplate an exceptional piece of work:... <br><br>
            On May 20 the new instruments were moved to the chambers of the Observatory,... <br><br>
            Now we can say the Observatory is as well equipped as it was poorly provided for in the past when one of the best astronomers Italy and indeed Europe has ever had was alive." <br><br>
            More than a year was needed to prepare the meridian observation room, from which Lusverg’s old semicircle had been removed, for the instruments. Modifications were made to the support wall for the mural instrument, making it shorter and at the same time more solid. "A pedestal with two doric style columns or pillars in a proportion that would satisfy needs as well as elegance" (140) was built to support the transit telescope. The lantern that illuminated the string meridian was renewed and, for the sake of ornamentation, a meridian line in marble and brass with analemmatic dial for describing the Time equation was added; this latter was the work of Ercole Lelli and is still to be seen on the floor of the room [file 3] (141). In August 1742 the instruments were finally installed and the operations of rectification and adjustment, that the archive records report in minutest detail, got under way. The three instruments represented the best equipment one could hope for in those days, equipment that until the end of the century would remain standard for positional astronomy: it is no coincidence that this was the type of instrument - identical down to the smallest detail - that Diderot and d’Alembert included in their Enciclopédie. <br><br>
            Their designer, Jonathan Sisson (1690?-1747), was collaborator and successor to Graham and it is known he was still working with him in 1743, a fact that leads us to suppose that Graham’s name too might be associated with the Bolognese instruments. These latter appear to be the oldest bearing Sisson’s name and the invoice for the mural quadrant, entirely in brass, suggests we bring the date forward for the use of a single metal in instrument making from 1743 to 1739, and credit Sisson and Graham with introducing this technique rather than John Bird (1709-1776) and James Bradley as Maurice Daumas maintains (142). Traditionally, in fact, these instruments had a brass limb and iron frame - as can be seen in Lusverg’s great mural semicircle - whereas using a single metal avoided the distorsions produced in a bimetaelic structure by variations in temperature. More than a year went by before Zanotti considered the instruments "rectified enough", even though in the years that followed the stability of the transit telescope left a good deal to be desired, as reported in the records. <br><br>
            It was finally only on September 26, 1749, that the series of observations began which would give rise to a catalogue of 413 stars included in the Zodiac belt and other major stars spread across the heavens. This can be considered the first catalogue of stars based on modern criteria and was published by Zanotti in the 1750 reprint of Manfredi’s Introductio in Ephemerides. The observations went on until August 14, 1750, and were complemented by a re-computation of the latitude of Bologna - which was found to be 44°29’54", just 1.2 arcseconds more than the actual value - and determination of the first point of Aries, i.e. the intersection of the equator and ecliptic corresponding to the vernal equinox. In the observations, Eustachio Zanotti manned the mural quadrant and Giovanni Angelo Brunelli (?-1791) the transit telescope. It was this latter scholar who provided the first experimental proof that radiant heat diminishes with the square of the distance from the source - as indeed light does - and who was later to become mathematician to the King of Portugal who gave him the brief of drawing up the map of Brazil (143). They were assisted in their observations by abbot Petronio Matteucci (?-1800) who was to become director of the Bologna Specola after the death of Zanotti. <br><br>
            The stars in the catalogue were all observed twice and the measurements accepted only when the differences did not exceed half a second in transit times and eight arcseconds in elevation. The positions were all reduced to the equinox of 1750, taking into account the precession of the equinoxes and Bradley aberration: it was in this way the first catalogue take account of this latter effect. Of no less importance, as was mentioned, was the computation of the position of the vernal equinox, a problem that was traditionally dealt with by first trying to identify the epoch of the solstices and equinoxes and then establishing the position of the stars relative to the Sun at the spring equinox. Before the introduction of the pendulum clock and telescope, this second measure was somewhat uncertain, particularly because of the difficulty of accurately transferring the time from day to night and the impossibility of observing the stars by day (144). With the introduction of these instruments - especially the pendulum clock designed by Christiaan Huygens and built by Salomon de Coster at Scheveningen in 1657 - both operations became possible, albeit fraught with difficulties. In the best tables available in the mid-XVIIIth century, those of Cassini and Halley, the epochs of the solstices differed by up to 11 minutes! <br><br>
            Manfredi "haec tabularum incommoda non tulit" and came up with a new method (145). In practice he substituted for "epochs", which are affected by the inequalities of motion of the Sun, the measurement of angles. While the mean epoch, between the moments when the Sun reaches the same elevation before and after the solstice, differs, because of the unequal movement of the Sun, from the epoch of the solstice itself, the mean difference in right ascension between a determined star and the Sun, measured when the Sun has equal elevation, is in effect equal to the difference in right ascension obtaining on the day of the solstice. Adding to this 90°, in the case of the summer solstice, or 270° for the winter solstice, one arrives at the right ascension of the star. Experimented by Manfredi in 1734, this method was applied by Zanotti in 1749. Introducing, as we said, the added refinement of correcting the differences in right ascension for effects caused by Bradley aberration, the uncertainty surrounding the position of the vernal equinox was reduced to about 5 arcseconds, the equivalent of 2 minutes of time in the epoch of the equinoxes. As Zanotti pointed out in the Commentarii, not only had Manfredi provided a method for computing the equinoxes, he had also "opened new avenues for the study of the theory of the Sun". It had in fact become possible to follow the motion of the Sun itself in right ascension more accurately than simply obtaining elevations from observations alone, given that atmospheric refraction was no longer part of the equation and the dependency of the value used for the inclination of the ecliptic was fairly small. <br><br>
            This was the last of the major contributions the Bolognese astronomers made to positional astronomy. Attention turned instead to celestial physics, and the mechanics and theory of gravitation, though studies underwent a progressive impoverishment that probably went hand in hand with the decadence that had set in in Bologna in the period before the Napoleonic era.

          <pa id="16"><strong>16. Petronio Matteucci and Giovan Battista Guglielmini - The weather-station and the final XVIIIth-century contribution to astronomy</strong><br><br>
            Eustachio Zanotti died in 1782 after more than 40 years of hard work and an incredible number of observations of the Sun, the Moon, the planets, comets and light variations of the stars, as well as a more varied range of activity that included restoration of the meridian line in San Petronio and the study of perspective (146). His successor in the post of director and the chair of Astronomy was the abbot Petronio Matteucci, assistant at the Specola since 1740 and esteemed aid, together with Giovanni Angelo Brunelli, of Manfredi and Zanotti. Matteucci was director of the Specola for almost twenty years, faithfully pursuing the age-old programme of calculus and publication of Ephemerides. Although he succeeded in renewing a good part of the equipment, with the purchase in England of a regulator clock by Ellicot [file 9], a wide-field telescope by Gilbert [file 43], a parallactic telescope, a long telescope and a reflecting telescope, all by the Londoners Dollond [files 37, 38, 39] - at the time sole producers of achromatic lenses - his research did not stand out particularly until the introduction of meteorology. <br><br>
            Bologna became part of the European network of meteorological observations, carrying on, albeit with various interruptions, the collection of data begun privately by in 1714 by the Bolognese physicist and chemist Jacopo Bartolomeo Beccari (1682-1766). The daily recording of temperature, pressure, winds and meteors was logged from 1782 to 1792, being later resumed by Matteucci’s successors and continuing without interruption from 1813 to today (file 92). It is thus possible to document the Bolognese climate almost uninterruptedly from the XVIIIth century, i.e. for almost three hundred years (147). Of note as regards Matteucci’s interest in meteorological events is his participation in an experiment carried out on July 27, 1752, by the physician Giuseppe Veratti (1707-1793) to demonstrate the electrical nature of lightening. This latter, following the advice of Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) in a letter of 29 July 1750, and almost contemporaneously with what Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon (1707-1788) was doing in France, had a metal rod placed on the terrace of the Specola. Touching the rod with keys at the approach of a thunder storm he felt, as he accurately described in a paper, effects "that were exactly the same as those of common Electricity." (148) <br><br>
            The last important XVIIIth-century Bolognese contribution to astronomy came from the abbot Giovan Battista Guglielmini who should have been assistant astronomer but whose nomination Matteucci refused to recognize in that it dated back to the period of the Cisalpine Republic. Professor of Mathematics at the University, Guglielmini would turn down the position of director of the Specola that was offered him in 1802. In 1790 he had an opening made at the foot of the spiral staircase of the tower to prolong to 29 m the fall of a heavy body from the top of the tower and measure the deviation south-eastwards from the vertical that Newton, who in 1679 had proposed a similar experiment to verify the Earth’s rotation, had predicted. The 4.5 mm displacement from the vertical that Guglielmini obtained was in close agreement with the deviation predicted for that height of 3.9 mm and the following year he repeated the experiment using the bigger drop (78 m) of the internal stair-well of the Asinelli Tower. <br><br>
            Although the Earth’s revolution around the Sun had already been proved, rotation around its own axis had not and Galileo himself had suggested using the experience of the fall of heavy bodies to provide the necessary proof. Guglielmini’s experiment was accurate to the tiniest detail, including carrying it out at night so that vibrations from passing carts would not interfere with the lead balls as they were dropped (149). Despite this however, and the extremely positive results too, his conclusions had very little resonance even though they did anticipate the celebrated experiment of Léon Foucault at the Pantheon in Paris by 50 years.

          <pa id="17"><strong>17. XIXth and XXth centuries - From cultural decadence to the building of the first dome in Loiano and the multi-mirror telescope</strong><br><br>
            After the death of Petronio Matteucci two directors were appointed in the space of a year, Girolamo Saladini from Lucca (1731-1813) and the above mentioned Giovan Battista Guglielmini of Bologna, both of whom, however, resigned. Whether it was these resignations that triggered off a long period of cultural decadence at the Specola or whether it was the stagnating scientific atmosphere that rather triggered them, is hard to say. The fact remains however, as Michele Rajna (director from 1903 to 1920) would point out, that throughout the XIXth century there were numerous testimonials to the state of general abandon astronomy had fallen into in Bologna. In 1802 Barnaba Oriani (1752-1832), director of the Specola in Milan, was sent to Bologna by order of the Italian Republic and found "Astronomy almost abandoned"; in 1840 the Viennese astronomer Karl Littrow (1811-1877) wrote of the Bolognese Specola: "on the whole it is comparable to an old building, which is of greater value to the archeologist than the astronomer"; the director of the Bordeaux Observatory, G. Rayet (1839-1906), describing in 1878 the Italian Specole for the French government, ended his chapter on Bologna with these words: "the Observatory is nothing more than a sort of Museum where the dust and rust corrode some of the historical instruments."(150) and a little later Pietro Tacchini (1838-1905) declared that "from 1874 on the abandoned state of the machinery and the ever increasing disorder in the Observatory have today made the instruments unuseable for actual astronomical observations", and expressed the hope that "the Observatory would not be forgotten and left in the indecent state it is in today." (151) <br><br>
            Numerous attempts were made by the local authorities, the national authorities and the astronomical community to revive the fortunes of Bolognese astronomy. Barnaba Oriani offered directorship of the Specola to Giuseppe Piazzi (1746-1826), already director of the Palermo Observatory, and J.G.F. Bohnenberger (1765-1831), astronomer from Tübingen, but neither accepted. Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti (1791-1863), mathematician, physicist and astronomer of great repute, did however accept, but his nomination by cardinal Opizzoni in 1835 was not ratified by the papal government because of his liberal ideas and participation in the Milanese conspiracies of 1821. Thus, despite the presence at the Specola of talented astronomers such as Francesco Bertelli (1794-1844), Gaetano Ceschi (?-1845) and Domenico Piani (1782-1870), work was limited to compilation of the Ephemerides, publication of which stopped in 1844 on account of the rapid development of analogous publications edited in Berlin, London and Paris. This long period of decadence was interrupted for a few years only during the brief directorships of Pietro Caturegli (1786-1833), Ignazio Calandrelli (1792-1866), Lorenzo Respighi (1824-1899) and Jacopo Michez (1839-1873). <br><br>
            The equipment was renewed to a some extent with the purchase of a movable quadrant by Mégnié (fl. end of XVIIIth century) who had won a prize at the Academié des Sciences in Paris [file 15], a transit telescope by Reichenbach, Utzschneider and Liebherr [file 20] - installed in the meridian Room in place of the age-old instrument by Sisson - and a meridian circle by Ertel & Sohn [file 22]. Although it required maximum stability, this well-made meridian circle was placed in the tower, 37 m off the ground, making it difficult to use and inaccurate; Respighi ended up using it exclusively as a zenithal instrument. "Respighi - Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835-1910) would write - whose memory is cherished by all us Italian astronomers, managed, with the few means on hand in the then almost abandoned Observatory and with others he knew how to get hold of, to make some important discoveries: three comets are named after him (1862 IV, 1863 III and 1863 V, note by Rajna, op.cit.), and his theoretical research on Optics, his computations of latitude and the Earth’s magnetism, the beginning of his observations on the scintillation of stars, the early applications of his special method for observing zenithal stars by means of reflection in a mercury bath, his works on Bolognese Climatology, all show how much can be achieved with little equipment by a man truly animated by the spirit of science".<br><br>
            When in 1865 Respighi moved as director to the papal Campidoglio Observatory in Rome for not wishing to swear allegiance to the new King of Italy, Alessandro Palagi (1811-1889) from Bologna and Antonio Saporetti (1821-1900) from Ravenna took over provisionally until the nomination of the above mentioned Paduan Jacopo Michez who worked with celestial mechanics (with several studies on the perturbative effects of the planets on the Biela’s Comet), the Earth’s magnetism and its variations during solar eclipses. His early death left the position of director at the Specola open once more. "Astronomy remained represented in Bologna - Rajna was to write (152) - by the forceful, original (if not completely composed and ordered) genius and vast learning of Quirico Filopanti, who never belonged to the Observatory and who after 1864, for reasons that do him honor, was never to hold an official position at the University again". Mechanic and physicist, Giuseppe Barilli (1812-1894) - he himself chose the pseudonym Quirico Filopanti in 1837 - had taken part in the Constituent Assembly of the Roman Republic and Garibaldi, who he had fought with in Trentino, called him his "teacher and professor of the infinitive". With the fall of the Republic, he took refuge in England from where he returned in 1861 to take up the chair of Mechanics and Physics at the University of Bologna which he had been awarded back in 1848. He was however removed from the chair again in 1864 for refusing to swear an oath to the new government. <br><br>
            The Specola was reduced, at the turn of the century, to making just meteorological observations until Michele Rajna, disciple of Schiaparelli, was appointed as director. "Nominated director and holder of the chair of Astronomy in February 1903 - Rajna wrote to the Rector of the Royal University of Bologna in 1906 - I have naturally studied conditions in the Observatory from close up...the idea of new equipment in the old tower is absolutely out of the question...But if we want - as we should want in Bologna - a real astronomical Laboratory, a Specola, that is, where truly useful observations can be made and scientific progress kept abreast of, the present seat must be abandoned". The new seat suggested by Rajna was Villa Aldini, 250 m above sea-level. The plan, begun with the purchase of a transit telescope by Bamberg, was never brought to a conclusion because of the early death of Rajna in 1920. Rajna’s successor was his assistant since 1912, Guido Horn-d’Arturo (1879-1967) who pressed ahead with his predecessor’s plan to build an observational station on the Bolognese Appenines. <br><br>
            In 1915 Adolfo Merlani, keen amateur astronomer and already assistant to the chair of Mathematical Analysis, had donated one and a quarter hectares of his land on Monte Donato (240 m above sea level) to the University of Bologna for the purposes of building there an observational station. Unfortunately, the land had been the site of ancient fortifications and was hence prone to subsidence: the project was therefore abandoned. In 1925, however, Merlani’s widow left the Observatory the substantial sum of three hundred thousand lire to buy a large telescope in honor of the memory of her husband. Horn-d’Arturo thus began negotiations with the company Karl Zeiss of Jena for the construction of a top quality reflector telescope with a 60 cm diameter (F/3.5). The instrument reached Bologna in July 1933 in nine boxes weighing a total of 60 quintals. In the meanwhile the University administration had bought two hectares of land on mount Orzale, 800 m above sea level, near the village of Loiano, some 40 km from Bologna. On November 15, 1936, the new observational station was inaugurated and on December 21 of the same year the first photograph with the new telescope was made. <br><br>
            Before the Zeiss reflector a small 15 cm equatorial telescope by Watson and Conrady had been bought, later used as guide telescope for the Zeiss reflector, and an astrograph with a 14 cm aperture. The observatory had in its possession, from the end of the previous century, a telescope by Steinheil with a 162 mm aperture and focal length of 260 cm [file 48], provisionally installed on a wooden frame by Tacchini who had used it to observe the transit of Venus across the solar disc in India. The lens of this telescope was to be fitted on the guide telescope of the Zeiss refractor. Besides the complete revitalization of the Bolognese Specola and its return to the international research circuit, another undisputed achievement of Horn-d’Arturo was the idea of obviating the difficulties of working optically on large surface areas by developing a "multi mirror" telescope. This was essentially the same technique used by the Americans in recent years with the Multi Mirror and the Keck Telescopes, producing a large reflecting surface area using numerous small "mirrors" of identical spherical curvature (153). <br><br>
            The first multi mirror designed by Horn-d’Arturo had a 1 m aperture and 10.5 m focal length and was placed in the top room of the tower - the present "Turret Room" in the museum - in line with a 1.2 m hole made in the roof back in 1725, which was used for carrying out zenithal observations with the long telescope tubes. To build the second multi mirror, comprising 61 mirrors, for a total aperture of 180 cm, a hole was drilled through four floors of the tower, under the small west dome where the meridian circle of Ertel & Sohn was lodged, thus obtaining a 24 m high and 2 m diameter cylinder. Using this instrument - recently put back to its original place [file 50] - and with the help of Giovanni Battista Lacchini and some technicians of the Specola, Aldo Galazzi and Orfeo Fusi Pecci, some tens of thousands of film exposures were obtained, carrying out a systematic survey of the zenith sky in Bologna. In the 6 minutes 45 seconds the plate - usually a "Cappelli Ultrasensibile" - was able to follow the motion of the sky, it was possible to photograph stars beyond the eighteenth magnitude, thus leading to the discovery of ten or so new variables. Among the commendable work done by Horn-d’Arturo, mention should be made of his contribution to the library, contemporary and historical - which he enlarged considerably -, his rescuing of a large part of the historical instrumentation, and his founding of the astronomical journal Coelum, the first issue of which came out in January 1931 and which closed after 55 years in 1986. With the end of Horn-d’Arturo’s directorship in 1954, we come to the end of our history, being too close to the contemporary and the lives of the present authors to write anything other than a chronicle.
